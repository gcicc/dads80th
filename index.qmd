This is a **living draft** — we built it from research, but only the family can make it real.

**Two ways to help:**

1. **[Fact-Check the Book](appendices/correct-the-record.qmd)** — We made 67 claims about Dad's life. Tell us what we got right, wrong, and missed.
2. **[Add Your Voice](chapters/ch09-voices.qmd)** — Write a memory, a message, or even just three words that describe Dad.

Every correction and every story makes the final book better. Even one sentence helps.

**March 2026** — Eighty years. A life that stretches from the streets of Bayonne to the skies over Vietnam, from the hallways of New Jersey's public schools to the warmth of a family dinner table. This is the story of Victor R. Cicconetti — veteran, educator, entrepreneur, community leader, husband, father, and grandfather. A man whose life truly is, as one newspaper described it, "an American story."
