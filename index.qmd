**March 2026** — Eighty years. A life that stretches from the streets of Bayonne to the skies over Vietnam, from the hallways of New Jersey's public schools to the warmth of a family dinner table. This is the story of Victor R. Cicconetti — veteran, educator, entrepreneur, community leader, husband, father, and grandfather. A man whose life truly is, as one newspaper described it, "an American story."
