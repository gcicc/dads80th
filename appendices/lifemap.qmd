**Dad & Mom:** We have the addresses but not always the stories. Pick any pin on the map and tell us what you remember about living there. What did the house look like? Who were the neighbors? What was happening in your life at that address?

**Anyone:** Do you remember visiting Vic and Yvonne at any of these addresses? What's the memory?
