# Correct the Record {#correct-the-record .unnumbered}

::: {.chapter-epigraph}
*Dad, Mom — we did our homework. We dug through newspapers, public records, census data, and old emails. We're pretty sure we got most of it right. But this is YOUR story, not ours. So here's everything we think we know. Tell us where we nailed it, where we blew it, and what we missed entirely.*
:::

## How This Works

We've listed every factual claim in this book. For each one, just pick one:

| | Meaning |
|---|---------|
| **TRUE** | Yes, that's right |
| **FALSE** | No, that's wrong |
| **I DON'T KNOW** | Not sure / don't remember |

After each section, there's a space to set the record straight — correct what we got wrong, fill in what we missed, or just tell us more.

2. ~~Names of all children~~ — **RESOLVED:** Two sons: Greg and Richard Victor Cicconetti
3. ~~Names of all grandchildren~~ — **RESOLVED:** Three: Ellie Wexler, Anthony John Cicconetti, Richard Victor Cicconetti Jr.
4. **The restaurant** — name, location, years, which son
5. **VVA Chapter 12** — founding year
6. **Where Victor served in Vietnam** — specific bases or locations
7. **How Victor and Yvonne met** — courtship story
8. **What the grandkids call him** — Pop-Pop? Grandpa? Something else?
