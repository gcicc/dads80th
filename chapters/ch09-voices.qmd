## A Family Tribute

On February 6, 2026, Greg sent an email with the subject line **"sshhh its a surprise"** to the inner circle: Yvonne, Rich, Kathy Pacifico, AJ, Ellie, Jen, Mike Hurley (both addresses), and Valerie & Frank Elia. The invitation: contribute a message for Dad's 80th birthday tribute book.

This chapter belongs to the family. Each person who knows and loves Victor has their own story to tell — their own memory, their own moment, their own way of saying what he means to them.

## From Yvonne {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-tip title="Tell Us a Story"}
**Mom:** What's the thing about Dad that nobody else sees? The private Vic — the one who exists when it's just the two of you? What do you want to say to him after almost sixty years together?

**Greg:** You've been building this book. You know the facts better than anyone. Now forget the facts — what's the *feeling*? What does "Love DAD" at the end of every email actually mean to you?

## From the Grandchildren {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-tip title="Tell Us a Story"}
**Grandkids:** Don't overthink this. Just answer one question: *What's the thing Grandpa does that always makes you smile?* Maybe it's the way he laughs. Maybe it's something he says every single time. Maybe it's a face he makes. Whatever it is — write it down. Even one sentence is perfect.
