*"Greg do you think you could purchase this pistol for me for target practice, I would like some ammo as well. Let me know. Love DAD"*

## Retirement, Jersey-Style

When Victor retired from public school administration in 2000, he didn't slow down. He and Yvonne had moved from the Bayonne/Shore area to **Galloway Township** and then **Egg Harbor City** in Atlantic County — southern New Jersey, near the Pine Barrens and the Shore, a quieter life but never a dull one.

Retirement for Vic has meant:

- **Atlantic City trips** — multiple references in his emails to "going to AC wed & thurs." The casinos, the boardwalk, the restaurants. It's part of the NJ retirement lifestyle, and Vic and Yvonne are regulars.

- **Target practice at 75** — In September 2021, Vic forwarded a Heartland America ad for a **Beeman Sportsman Deluxe Air Pistol** ($49.99, .177 caliber) and asked Greg to order it. At seventy-five, Vic was still shooting, still active, still keeping his edge. The casual "Love DAD" sign-off on a request for ammunition is peak Vic.

- **Wisdom curator** — Vic forwards chain emails to his sons and brother-in-law Mike Hurley about life philosophy, faith, humor, and politics. He doesn't just consume this content — he *curates* it, selecting messages he believes carry real meaning and sharing them with the people he loves. The "Gift of Time" parable about Alexander the Great. Inspirational stories. Life lessons. Vic sees himself as passing wisdom to the next generation.

## How Vic Communicates

Victor's email style is a window into his personality:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Brief subject-as-message** | Subject: "How you doing?" Body: empty |
| **Emotional milestone responses** | "Dearest Son, I hope you can take a long breath and exhale!!!!" |
| **The check-in** | "What's happening? Did you hear from them? We are going to AC wed & thurs be back Fri pm. Call you later. Dad" |
| **Proud grandpa** | "Look at yourselves!!!!" (with photo, no body text) |
| **Consistent sign-off** | "Love DAD" — every single time |
| **Consistent greeting** | "Dearest Son" or "Dearest Greg" |

The man who grew up before email, before texting, before social media — he adapted to the digital age on his own terms. Brief. Warm. Consistent. And always ending with love.

**Dad:** Do you have an Atlantic City system? Be honest — slots, poker, blackjack, craps? What's your biggest win? And what about the one you probably shouldn't tell us about?

**Mom:** What's the thing Dad does in retirement that drives you absolutely crazy? And what's the thing he does that still makes you fall in love with him all over again?

## Faith

Vic's faith threads through his communication naturally, without preaching:

> "The Lord has blessed you once more."

That's how he frames milestones — as blessings, not just achievements. The Catholic boy from Bayonne, who married at Assumption Church and raised his family in faith, still sees the hand of God in his children's successes.

## The Walk-Around-the-House Laugh

After his 75th birthday party in 2021, Vic sent a thank-you email to Greg's family that captures something essential about who he is:

> "I am still laughing at your antics on the video. I can be walking around the house and suddenly I think of Greg and Val and man I start smiling then laughing."

Picture it: Vic, alone in the house, walking from room to room, and suddenly — a memory from the party hits him, and he laughs out loud. Not once, but again and again, days later. This is a man who holds joy close. Who lets the good moments replay. Who walks around his house and laughs at the love of his family.

That image — Vic wandering the house, suddenly breaking into laughter — belongs in any portrait of who this man really is.

We wrote this chapter mostly from your emails. But we want the rest of the picture.

- What does a normal Tuesday look like for you?
- Which casino is your casino? Do you have a system?
- Are you still shooting? Still doing target practice?
- What do you watch? What do you read? What music?
- What makes you laugh the hardest?
- What's the thing you do that drives Mom crazy but she secretly loves?

**Mom:** What's the thing *he* does that drives you crazy? And what's the thing about him that still makes you smile after all these years?

**Everyone else:** What's the funniest recent Vic story? The most recent time he made you laugh until you cried?

*At eighty, Victor Cicconetti is still shopping for air pistols, still going to Atlantic City, still forwarding wisdom to his sons, and still walking around the house laughing at memories of his family. That's a life well lived.*
