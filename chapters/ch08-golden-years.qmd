At 80, Vic's still going. Still shopping for air pistols, still hitting AC, still signing every email "Love DAD." Here's the soundtrack for a man who earned every note:

**The Victory Lap**

- Frank Sinatra — "My Way" *(the only possible closer)*
- Dean Martin — "Ain't That a Kick in the Head"
- Springsteen — "Land of Hope and Dreams" / "No Surrender"
- Tom Petty — "I Won't Back Down"
- Billy Joel — "Piano Man" / "Scenes from an Italian Restaurant"
- Elvis — "Can't Help Falling in Love"
- Bob Seger — "Like a Rock"
- The Four Seasons — "December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)"
- Sinatra — "The Best Is Yet to Come"
- Whatever's playing at the Borgata right now

*What does Dad actually listen to these days? What station is the car radio stuck on? What song does he sing in the shower? [Suggest a song.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/YOUR_FORM_ID/viewform)*

::: {.callout-note title="The World Since Retirement (2000–2026)" collapse="true"}
**The broadest wavelet:** Vic retired into a century that started with a shock. On **September 11, 2001** — just a year into his retirement — the Twin Towers fell. From New Jersey's shoreline, you could see the smoke rising from Lower Manhattan. The Pentagon was hit. A plane went down in Pennsylvania. For a Vietnam veteran watching from across the harbor, it was a new kind of war — and this one was hitting home.

Then came the wars that followed: Afghanistan (2001–2021), Iraq (2003–2011). A Vietnam veteran watching a new generation of young Americans shipped overseas. The financial crisis of **2008** — the Great Recession, the worst economic collapse since the Depression. And then **COVID-19** in **2020** — a pandemic that locked the country down, separated families, and killed over a million Americans. Vic was 74 when the pandemic hit. For a man whose life was built on family proximity and gathering, the isolation was its own kind of hardship.

**The Jersey wavelet:** **Superstorm Sandy** slammed into the Jersey Shore on **October 29, 2012**, devastating the boardwalks, beach towns, and communities that had been the Cicconetti family's world for decades. Seaside Heights' boardwalk — an icon of Shore culture — burned. Homes along the coast were destroyed. Point Pleasant, Avon, Belmar — all of them took hits. The Shore rebuilt, because that's what the Shore does. But the families who lived through Sandy never forgot.

**The personal wavelet:** Through all of it — 9/11, two wars, a financial crisis, a superstorm, a pandemic — Vic and Yvonne held steady. The same partnership that had weathered Vietnam, career building, and child-rearing now weathered the disruptions of the new century. Still together. Still going to AC. Still signing every email "Love DAD."

## Retirement, Jersey-Style

When Victor retired from public school administration in 2000, he didn't slow down. He and Yvonne had moved from the Bayonne/Shore area to **Galloway Township** and then **Egg Harbor City** in Atlantic County — southern New Jersey, near the Pine Barrens and the Shore, a quieter life but never a dull one.

Retirement for Vic has meant:

- **Atlantic City trips** — multiple references in his emails to "going to AC wed & thurs." The casinos, the boardwalk, the restaurants. It's part of the NJ retirement lifestyle, and Vic and Yvonne are regulars. And AC has delivered its share of stories — including the time Vic **shook hands with O.J. Simpson** at a fight in Atlantic City. Yes, *that* O.J. The kind of random, only-in-AC celebrity encounter that becomes a family story told at every gathering for the next thirty years. Vic was there. O.J. was there. Hands were shaken. The family has opinions.

- **Target practice at 75** — In September 2021, Vic forwarded a Heartland America ad for a **Beeman Sportsman Deluxe Air Pistol** ($49.99, .177 caliber) and asked Greg to order it. At seventy-five, Vic was still shooting, still active, still keeping his edge. The casual "Love DAD" sign-off on a request for ammunition is peak Vic.

- **The daily briefing** — Vic stays engaged with the world. **Fox News** is the soundtrack of the house. **Mark Levin** is the voice on the radio. He and Yvonne watch, listen, debate, and form opinions — together, always together. They are not passive consumers. They are citizens who care deeply about the direction of their country, informed by a lifetime of experience that runs from Vietnam to the present.

- **Wisdom curator** — Vic forwards emails to his sons and brother-in-law Mike Hurley about life philosophy, faith, humor, and politics. He doesn't just consume this content — he *curates* it, selecting messages he believes carry real meaning and sharing them with the people he loves. The "Gift of Time" parable about Alexander the Great. Patriotic stories. Inspirational messages. Political commentary. Life lessons. Vic sees himself as passing wisdom — and conviction — to the next generation. The forward list is his broadcast network, and the signal is always the same: *this matters, and I want you to see it*.

## "Glue Fingers" and the Old Crew

Some identities don't fade. Somewhere in a box or a scrapbook, there's an old newspaper clipping where a young Victor Cicconetti earned the nickname **"Glue Fingers Cicconetti"** — a receiver who didn't drop the ball. That was high school football in Bayonne, where Friday nights under the lights were the center of the social universe and a good nickname followed you for life.

In his later years, Vic has enjoyed **periodic gatherings with his old high school football buddies** — the guys who blocked for him, ran alongside him, and shared the locker room camaraderie that becomes, decades later, one of the purest forms of friendship a man can have. No pretense. No agenda. Just men who knew each other when they were seventeen and still show up for each other at seventy-nine.

The football brotherhood and the veteran brotherhood overlap in Vic's life — both are groups of men who went through something intense together and never let go of the bond. "Glue Fingers" caught passes in Bayonne. Then he caught wounded soldiers in medevac helicopters. Then he caught students who were falling through the cracks. The hands never stopped reaching.

## The Shore Pilgrimage

Even after moving south to Galloway and Egg Harbor City, Vic and Yvonne never let go of the Shore. At 79, they still make the pilgrimage — north on the Parkway to the places where they raised their family, where the kids grew up, where the memories live.

The destinations are always the same, because that's the point:

- **Avon-by-the-Sea** — the quiet beach town with the Victorian boardwalk, where the ocean is the attraction and the crowds stay away. Not Seaside Heights. Not Wildwood. *Avon.* That tells you everything about Vic and Yvonne's taste.
- **Point Pleasant Beach** — the boardwalk, Jenkinson's, the fishing pier, the arcades where the grandkids play the same games the kids played thirty years ago. Shore culture passed down.
- **Pete & Elda's** — the thin-crust pizza institution in Neptune City, open since 1956. Every Shore family has a Pete & Elda's booth that feels like theirs. The Cicconettis' is no different.
- **Kelly's Tavern** — cold drinks, familiar faces, the kind of place where Vic walks in and someone says "hey, Vic."

These aren't restaurants and beaches. They're *landmarks on the map of a life*. The Shark River Hills years, the Wall Township years — decades of Shore living compressed into an afternoon drive and a pizza that tastes like 1985.

That they still make this trip, into their late seventies and now approaching eighty — that's not nostalgia. That's identity. The Jersey Shore isn't where Vic vacations. It's where Vic *is*.

::: {.callout-tip title="Tell Us a Shore Story"}
**Everyone:** What's the definitive Cicconetti Shore story? The beach day that went sideways? The Pete & Elda's night that turned legendary? The time at Kelly's that nobody's allowed to talk about? The boardwalk game somebody FINALLY won after twenty years of trying?

**Dad & Mom:** Is there a beach, a bench, a spot on the boardwalk that's *yours*? The place you go when it's just the two of you?

## How Vic Communicates

Victor's email style is a window into his personality:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Brief subject-as-message** | Subject: "How you doing?" Body: empty |
| **Emotional milestone responses** | "Dearest Son, I hope you can take a long breath and exhale!!!!" |
| **The check-in** | "What's happening? Did you hear from them? We are going to AC wed & thurs be back Fri pm. Call you later. Dad" |
| **Proud grandpa** | "Look at yourselves!!!!" (with photo, no body text) |
| **Consistent sign-off** | "Love DAD" — every single time |
| **Consistent greeting** | "Dearest Son" or "Dearest Greg" |

The man who grew up before email, before texting, before social media — he adapted to the digital age on his own terms. Brief. Warm. Consistent. And always ending with love.

**Dad:** Do you have an Atlantic City system? Be honest — slots, poker, blackjack, craps? What's your biggest win? And what about the one you probably shouldn't tell us about?

**Mom:** What's the thing Dad does in retirement that drives you absolutely crazy? And what's the thing he does that still makes you fall in love with him all over again?

## Faith

Vic's faith threads through his communication naturally, without preaching:

> "The Lord has blessed you once more."

That's how he frames milestones — as blessings, not just achievements. The Catholic boy from Bayonne, who married at Assumption Church and raised his family in faith, still sees the hand of God in his children's successes.

## The Walk-Around-the-House Laugh

After his 75th birthday party in 2021, Vic sent a thank-you email to Greg's family that captures something essential about who he is:

> "I am still laughing at your antics on the video. I can be walking around the house and suddenly I think of Greg and Val and man I start smiling then laughing."

Picture it: Vic, alone in the house, walking from room to room, and suddenly — a memory from the party hits him, and he laughs out loud. Not once, but again and again, days later. This is a man who holds joy close. Who lets the good moments replay. Who walks around his house and laughs at the love of his family.

That image — Vic wandering the house, suddenly breaking into laughter — belongs in any portrait of who this man really is.

We wrote this chapter mostly from your emails. But we want the rest of the picture.

- What does a normal Tuesday look like for you?
- Which casino is your casino? Do you have a system?
- Are you still shooting? Still doing target practice?
- What do you watch? What do you read? What music?
- What makes you laugh the hardest?
- What's the thing you do that drives Mom crazy but she secretly loves?

**Mom:** What's the thing *he* does that drives you crazy? And what's the thing about him that still makes you smile after all these years?

**Everyone else:** What's the funniest recent Vic story? The most recent time he made you laugh until you cried?

*At eighty, Victor Cicconetti is still shopping for air pistols, still going to Atlantic City, still forwarding wisdom to his sons, and still walking around the house laughing at memories of his family. That's a life well lived.*
