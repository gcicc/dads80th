::: {.callout-note title="The World Since Retirement (2000–2026)" collapse="true"}
**The broadest wavelet:** Vic retired into a century that started with a shock. On **September 11, 2001** — just a year into his retirement — the Twin Towers fell. From New Jersey's shoreline, you could see the smoke rising from Lower Manhattan. The Pentagon was hit. A plane went down in Pennsylvania. For a Vietnam veteran watching from across the harbor, it was a new kind of war — and this one was hitting home.

Then came the wars that followed: Afghanistan (2001–2021), Iraq (2003–2011). A Vietnam veteran watching a new generation of young Americans shipped overseas. The financial crisis of **2008** — the Great Recession, the worst economic collapse since the Depression. And then **COVID-19** in **2020** — a pandemic that locked the country down, separated families, and killed over a million Americans. Vic was 74 when the pandemic hit. For a man whose life was built on family proximity and gathering, the isolation was its own kind of hardship.

**The Jersey wavelet:** **Superstorm Sandy** slammed into the Jersey Shore on **October 29, 2012**, devastating the boardwalks, beach towns, and communities that had been the Cicconetti family's world for decades. Seaside Heights' boardwalk — an icon of Shore culture — burned. Homes along the coast were destroyed. Point Pleasant, Avon, Belmar — all of them took hits. The Shore rebuilt, because that's what the Shore does. But the families who lived through Sandy never forgot.

**The personal wavelet:** Through all of it — 9/11, two wars, a financial crisis, a superstorm, a pandemic — Vic and Yvonne held steady. The same partnership that had weathered Vietnam, career building, and child-rearing now weathered the disruptions of the new century. Still together. Still going to AC. Still signing every email "Love DAD."
:::

## Retirement, Jersey-Style

When Victor retired from public school administration in 2000, he didn't slow down. He and Yvonne had moved from the Bayonne/Shore area to **Galloway Township** and then **Egg Harbor City** in Atlantic County — southern New Jersey, near the Pine Barrens and the Shore, a quieter life but never a dull one.

Retirement for Vic has meant:

- **Atlantic City trips** — multiple references in his emails to "going to AC wed & thurs." The casinos, the boardwalk, the restaurants. It's part of the NJ retirement lifestyle, and Vic and Yvonne are regulars. And AC has delivered its share of stories — including the time Vic **shook hands with O.J. Simpson** at a fight in Atlantic City. Yes, *that* O.J. The kind of random, only-in-AC celebrity encounter that becomes a family story told at every gathering for the next thirty years. Vic was there. O.J. was there. Hands were shaken. The family has opinions.

- **Target practice at 75** — In September 2021, Vic forwarded a Heartland America ad for a **Beeman Sportsman Deluxe Air Pistol** ($49.99, .177 caliber) and asked Greg to order it. At seventy-five, Vic was still shooting, still active, still keeping his edge. The casual "Love DAD" sign-off on a request for ammunition is peak Vic.

- **The daily briefing** — Vic stays engaged with the world. **Fox News** is the soundtrack of the house. **Mark Levin** is the voice on the radio. He and Yvonne watch, listen, debate, and form opinions — together, always together. They are not passive consumers. They are citizens who care deeply about the direction of their country, informed by a lifetime of experience that runs from Vietnam to the present.

- **Wisdom curator** — Vic forwards emails to his sons and brother-in-law Mike Hurley about life philosophy, faith, humor, and politics. He doesn't just consume this content — he *curates* it, selecting messages he believes carry real meaning and sharing them with the people he loves. The "Gift of Time" parable about Alexander the Great. Patriotic stories. Inspirational messages. Political commentary. Life lessons. Vic sees himself as passing wisdom — and conviction — to the next generation. The forward list is his broadcast network, and the signal is always the same: *this matters, and I want you to see it*.

## The World That Changed Around Him

::: {.callout-note title="80 Years of Everyday Things" collapse="true"}
**Technology didn't just change in Vic's lifetime — it changed *everything*, over and over, and he lived through every transition:**

**In the kitchen:**
The icebox became a refrigerator. The wringer washer became an automatic. The dish-drying rack became a dishwasher. The percolator became a Mr. Coffee became a Keurig. Frozen TV dinners arrived in 1954 and blew people's minds. The microwave oven — military technology repurposed for leftovers — showed up in homes in the late 1970s and changed what "cooking" even meant.

**In the living room:**
Three channels became cable (1980s) became satellite (1990s) became streaming (2010s) became *too many choices to count*. The family gathered around *one* television; now everyone has a screen in their pocket. The VCR arrived and you could record a show — revolutionary. Then the DVD. Then the DVR. Then Netflix made all of it obsolete. Vic has lived through every format of recorded entertainment: vinyl records, 8-tracks, cassette tapes, CDs, MP3s, and whatever his grandkids are using now.

**In communication:**
The rotary phone (shared, on the wall, don't tie up the line) became the push-button phone became the cordless phone became the cell phone became the smartphone. The answering machine was a miracle — someone could leave a message when you weren't home! Then voicemail. Then text messages. Then FaceTime. Vic's generation went from *waiting for the mail* to *instant video calls with grandchildren 200 miles away*. His email forwards — the ones he curates and sends to his sons every morning — are his version of the letters his grandparents sent from Italy. Same instinct. Different wire.

**In the car:**
No seatbelts → seatbelts → airbags → backup cameras → cars that park themselves. Manual everything → power steering → cruise control → GPS navigation. Vic learned to drive on a car you had to *crank*. His grandchildren will learn to drive on cars that drive themselves.

**In school (where Vic spent his career):**
Chalkboards → overhead projectors → VCRs in the classroom → computer labs → laptops for every student → AI tutors. Vic was *ahead* of this curve — writing grants for Commodore computers in 1982 when most schools didn't even have a computer room. He saw the future before the district budget caught up.

The man who was born into a world of rotary phones and iceboxes now lives in a world of smartphones and AI. And he adapted to every single transition — not because he's a technologist, but because he's a man who refuses to be left behind.

## "Glue Fingers" and the Old Crew

Some identities don't fade. Somewhere in a box or a scrapbook, there's an old newspaper clipping where a young Victor Cicconetti earned the nickname **"Glue Fingers Cicconetti"** — a receiver who didn't drop the ball. That was high school football in Bayonne, where Friday nights under the lights were the center of the social universe and a good nickname followed you for life.

In his later years, Vic has enjoyed **periodic gatherings with his old high school football buddies** — the guys who blocked for him, ran alongside him, and shared the locker room camaraderie that becomes, decades later, one of the purest forms of friendship a man can have. No pretense. No agenda. Just men who knew each other when they were seventeen and still show up for each other at seventy-nine.

The football brotherhood and the veteran brotherhood overlap in Vic's life — both are groups of men who went through something intense together and never let go of the bond. "Glue Fingers" caught passes in Bayonne. Then he caught wounded soldiers in medevac helicopters. Then he caught students who were falling through the cracks. The hands never stopped reaching.

## The Shore Pilgrimage

Even after moving south to Galloway and Egg Harbor City, Vic and Yvonne never let go of the Shore. At 79, they still make the pilgrimage — north on the Parkway to the places where they raised their family, where the kids grew up, where the memories live.

The destinations are always the same, because that's the point:

- **Avon-by-the-Sea** — the quiet beach town with the Victorian boardwalk, where the ocean is the attraction and the crowds stay away. Not Seaside Heights. Not Wildwood. *Avon.* That tells you everything about Vic and Yvonne's taste.
- **Point Pleasant Beach** — the boardwalk, Jenkinson's, the fishing pier, the arcades where the grandkids play the same games the kids played thirty years ago. Shore culture passed down.
- **Pete & Elda's** — the thin-crust pizza institution in Neptune City, open since 1956. Every Shore family has a Pete & Elda's booth that feels like theirs. The Cicconettis' is no different.
- **Kelly's Tavern** — cold drinks, familiar faces, the kind of place where Vic walks in and someone says "hey, Vic."

These aren't restaurants and beaches. They're *landmarks on the map of a life*. The Shark River Hills years, the Wall Township years — decades of Shore living compressed into an afternoon drive and a pizza that tastes like 1985.

That they still make this trip, into their late seventies and now approaching eighty — that's not nostalgia. That's identity. The Jersey Shore isn't where Vic vacations. It's where Vic *is*.

::: {.callout-tip title="Tell Us a Shore Story"}
**Everyone:** What's the definitive Cicconetti Shore story? The beach day that went sideways? The Pete & Elda's night that turned legendary? The time at Kelly's that nobody's allowed to talk about? The boardwalk game somebody FINALLY won after twenty years of trying?

**Dad & Mom:** Is there a beach, a bench, a spot on the boardwalk that's *yours*? The place you go when it's just the two of you?

## How Vic Communicates

Victor's email style is a window into his personality:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Brief subject-as-message** | Subject: "How you doing?" Body: empty |
| **Emotional milestone responses** | "Dearest Son, I hope you can take a long breath and exhale!!!!" |
| **The check-in** | "What's happening? Did you hear from them? We are going to AC wed & thurs be back Fri pm. Call you later. Dad" |
| **Proud grandpa** | "Look at yourselves!!!!" (with photo, no body text) |
| **Consistent sign-off** | "Love DAD" — every single time |
| **Consistent greeting** | "Dearest Son" or "Dearest Greg" |

The man who grew up before email, before texting, before social media — he adapted to the digital age on his own terms. Brief. Warm. Consistent. And always ending with love.

**Mom:** What's the thing Dad does in retirement that drives you absolutely crazy? And what's the thing he does that still makes you fall in love with him all over again?

## Faith

Vic's faith threads through everything he does. Not the quiet, private kind that stays in the pew. The *Vic* kind — persistent, vocal, and coming at you whether you asked for it or not.

> "The Lord has blessed you once more."

That's how he frames milestones — as blessings, not just achievements. Every email, every phone call, every milestone: *pray about it*. A grandchild's graduation? *The Lord has blessed you*. A new job? *God is good*. A rough patch? *Have you prayed on it?*

Here's the thing: the Cicconetti family stopped going to church decades ago. After Rich finished grammar school, they were done with the monotony of Catholic Mass. The whole family moved on. And then Vic found his Baptist church, did his deep dive into scripture, and came out the other side as the family's **permanent, unsolicited spiritual advisor**.

The joke in the family — and it *is* a joke, told with love — goes like this:

*"Did Dad have a few drinks and corner you to talk about the Bible again?"*

Because that's what happens. A family gathering. A barbecue. A holiday. Vic has a couple of drinks, and suddenly you're getting a one-on-one about prayer, about gratitude, about what the scriptures say about perseverance. He doesn't do it from a pulpit. He does it from a lawn chair, or the kitchen counter, or the driver's seat on the way to Point Pleasant. He persists through resistance. He *always* persists through resistance.

Nobody in the family goes to church anymore. But Vic never stopped being the voice that says: **pray**. Pray when things are good. Pray when things are bad. Pray when you don't feel like it. *Especially* when you don't feel like it.

It's not performative. It's not preachy — well, it's a *little* preachy. But it's real. The man who read the Bible cover to cover, who led youth groups, who joined a Baptist church to challenge himself — that man didn't stop when the formal churchgoing stopped. He just moved the ministry to the dinner table, the phone call, the email forward. His congregation is his family, and his sermons never end.

The Catholic boy from Bayonne, who married at Assumption Church, who left the monotony of Mass, who walked into a Baptist church, who read the whole book, who now signs his emails with "God bless" and calls his sons to tell them to pray — that man's faith isn't a Sunday habit. It's a Tuesday habit. A Wednesday habit. An every-damn-day habit. And if you're within earshot after he's had a glass of wine? You're going to hear about it.

## The Walk-Around-the-House Laugh

After his 75th birthday party in 2021, Vic sent a thank-you email to Greg's family that captures something essential about who he is:

> "I am still laughing at your antics on the video. I can be walking around the house and suddenly I think of Greg and Val and man I start smiling then laughing."

Picture it: Vic, alone in the house, walking from room to room, and suddenly — a memory from the party hits him, and he laughs out loud. Not once, but again and again, days later. This is a man who holds joy close. Who lets the good moments replay. Who walks around his house and laughs at the love of his family.

That image — Vic wandering the house, suddenly breaking into laughter — belongs in any portrait of who this man really is.

::: {.callout-note title="America's Changing Relationship with Marijuana" collapse="true"}
**The broadest wavelet:** Few substances trace the arc of American culture as cleanly as marijuana. When Vic was growing up in the 1950s, cannabis was the stuff of *Reefer Madness* propaganda — a Schedule I narcotic lumped with heroin, a moral panic in plant form. By the time he was in Vietnam, it was everywhere among the troops — a coping mechanism for the uncopeable.

- **1970:** Nixon signed the Controlled Substances Act, classifying marijuana as Schedule I — "no accepted medical use, high potential for abuse." The War on Drugs began.
- **1980s–90s:** Reagan and Clinton escalated enforcement. "Just Say No." Mandatory minimums. By 1997, nearly **700,000 Americans** were arrested annually for marijuana offenses — more than for all violent crimes combined.
- **1996:** California passed **Proposition 215**, the first medical marijuana law. The dam cracked.
- **2012:** Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize recreational use.
- **2020:** New Jersey voters approved **Question 1**, legalizing recreational marijuana. Vic's home state.
- **2024:** By now, 24 states plus DC have legalized recreational use. The substance that could get you prison time when Vic was raising his family is now sold in storefronts down the road from his house.

The generation that grew up with "Just Say No" is now the generation buying edibles at a dispensary. The country didn't just change its laws — it changed its entire moral framework around a plant. For a man who has lived through Vietnam, Watergate, the War on Drugs, and legalization — all in one lifetime — the whiplash is its own kind of American experience.

## The Whole Man

A tribute book that only tells the shiny parts isn't a tribute — it's a greeting card. Vic deserves better than that. So here's the rest.

Victor Cicconetti was a **closet smoker** for most of his adult life. Cigarettes, quietly, for decades. The man who ran triathlons with his family, who went on health kicks with Eve, who coached soccer and led youth groups — he also smoked, and he kept it to himself as best he could.

He watched his own father drink himself to death at fifty-five. He joined a Baptist church to break the cycles he didn't want to repeat. He read the Bible cover to cover. He ran. He pushed everyone around him to be better. And through all of it, he carried this one habit he couldn't put down.

Now, at eighty, the bill has come due. Vic has **emphysema** — the slow narrowing of the lungs, the shortening of breath, the tax the body collects on the years of smoke. It's there. It's real. It shapes his days.

But here's the thing about Vic: **he won't back down**.

He still goes to AC. He still drives to Point Pleasant. He still forwards emails at 6 AM. He still walks around the house laughing at memories of his family. He still signs every message "Love DAD." The emphysema has taken some of his breath, but it has not taken one ounce of who he is.

The man who flew medevac helicopters through combat zones, who walked into a student walkout and led a prayer, who bumped a rifle score by a point to get his kid across the line — that man is not going to let his lungs have the last word.

*I won't back down.* Tom Petty wrote it. Vic lives it.

*At eighty, Victor Cicconetti is still shopping for air pistols, still going to Atlantic City, still forwarding wisdom to his sons, and still walking around the house laughing at memories of his family. That's a life well lived.*
