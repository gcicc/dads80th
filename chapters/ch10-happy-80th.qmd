## A Life Well Lived

As Victor R. Cicconetti turns eighty, the measure of his life is not found in any single achievement — but in the remarkable breadth of what he has given.

**To his country:** Four years of service as an Air Force medic, flying into danger to bring wounded servicemembers home from Vietnam.

**To his students:** Decades of dedication in New Jersey's public schools, shaping young lives from Long Branch to Asbury Park — the "Man with Many Missions."

**To his fellow veterans:** A founding voice for Vietnam Veterans of America Chapter 12, ensuring that those who served were never forgotten. Life memberships in the VA and the DAV. A lifetime of showing up.

**To his family:** Nearly sixty years of partnership with Yvonne. Three children. Six grandchildren. A home built on love, food, Italian-American tradition, and the two most important words in his vocabulary: [Love DAD]{.love-dad}.

**To his community:** Entrepreneurship, education, advocacy, and the quiet daily work of being a good neighbor, a good friend, and a good man.

## The Story So Far

Victor's story is — as a New Jersey newspaper once wrote — "an American story." It is the story of Italian immigrants who left the mountains of Abruzzo for the streets of Bayonne. It is the story of a young man who answered his country's call at nineteen and flew medevac missions in Vietnam. It is the story of a veteran who came home and built a career helping young people. It is the story of a husband, a father, and a grandfather who signs every email with love.

From Collepietro to Bayonne. From the Air Force to the classroom. From the classroom to the restaurant to the VVA hall. From one generation to the next — and the next — and the next.

**Everyone:** If you could describe Vic in exactly three words — just three — what would they be?

And one more: What's the thing about Victor Cicconetti that you want his great-grandchildren to know someday?

## Still Going

At eighty, Vic is still shopping for air pistols. Still going to AC. Still forwarding life wisdom to his sons. Still walking around the house and suddenly breaking into laughter at the memory of his family's antics.

Still the same man from Bayonne who answered the call.

Happy 80th birthday, Dad.

Your story is far from over.
