::: {.callout-note title="The Italian-American Family: A Different Kind of Institution" collapse="true"}
**The broadest wavelet:** The Italian-American family was never just a family — it was a *system*. A social safety net, an employment agency, a marriage bureau, a banking institution, and a tribunal of justice rolled into one. In the old country, the *famiglia* was the only institution that mattered — the government was distant, the Church was powerful but abstract, and the *padrone* exploited you. Your family fed you, housed you, and protected you.

When Italians came to America, they brought this system with them. Sunday dinners weren't optional. Family decisions were collective. You didn't move away without a reason everyone could accept. You married someone the family approved of (or you eloped and dealt with the consequences). You named your children after your parents and grandparents — a chain of names linking the generations.

By the time Vic and Yvonne were raising their family in the 1970s and 80s, the old-country strictness had softened, but the core values held: **loyalty, proximity, showing up**. The Cicconetti family — two educators, two sons, Shore living — was the Italian-American dream fully realized. Not wealth, but stability. Not fame, but respect. Not distance, but closeness.
:::

## Two Sons, Three Grandchildren

At the center of Victor's life is family. He and Yvonne raised **two sons** — Greg and Rich — in a household shaped by two educators, Italian-American values, and the quiet strength of parents who had built their lives from scratch.

### Greg Cicconetti

Greg — the eldest — earned a Ph.D. from the University of Connecticut, held a faculty position at Muhlenberg College, spent a decade at GSK, and became a Research Fellow at AbbVie. The son of a public school administrator and a health teacher built a career in clinical statistics and drug development. Greg has two children: **Ellie Wexler** and **Anthony John Cicconetti**.

### Richard Victor Cicconetti

Rich studied at **Rutgers University** and has built a career in technology, specializing in form-building solutions through his business, **Cicco Devel**. He and his wife **Sharon** (nee Doughty) live in Galloway, NJ — close to Victor and Yvonne, keeping the family geography tight. Rich represents the next generation: rooted in New Jersey, connected to family, and building something of his own. Rich has one son: **Richard Victor Cicconetti Jr.**, known as **Richy**.

Sharon joined the family as Sharon Katherine Doughty. Her father, **Clarence S. "Clancy" Doughty, Jr.**, passed away in July 2024 — a recent loss the family felt deeply.

### The Grandchildren

Victor and Yvonne have three biological grandchildren:

- **Ellie Wexler** (Greg's daughter)
- **Anthony John Cicconetti** (Greg's son)
- **Richard Victor Cicconetti Jr. "Richy"** (Rich's son)

## The Coach, the Ref, and the Thumb on the Scale

Vic coached soccer. He was *in it* — organizing practices, running drills, doing the thing that dads in Shore communities did on Saturday mornings. He loved it.

Greg did not love it. Greg did not love any of it.

The Greg Cicconetti athletic career is a highlight reel of heroic disinterest:

- **Baseball:** Famous for doing cartwheels in the outfield and kicking dandelions while the game happened around him. The uniforms were itchy. The whole enterprise was suspect.
- **Soccer:** The only goal Greg ever scored was in **kindergarten** — and it was against his own team. Career shooting percentage: technically perfect, if you don't ask which net.
- **Basketball:** Lasted exactly one session. There was no second session.

Vic, the former "Glue Fingers" of Bayonne high school football, watched all of this and did not give up. That's its own kind of parenting — the athlete father who keeps showing up for the kid who is never going to be an athlete, without making the kid feel like a failure for it.

### The Marksman Medal

But the rifle team — that's where the story gets complicated, and real, and *Vic*.

Greg was on the rifle team. Vic was there as **parent support** — involved, present, doing the behind-the-scenes work that makes youth programs run. At a competition, Greg's score came in **just shy of making marksman**. One point short.

And Vic — the rule-follower, the school administrator, the man who built his career on institutional trust — **bumped the score by a point**. He pushed his son across the line.

Greg hated it. He didn't want to cheat. He knew the score was wrong. But in that moment, standing there with a medal he hadn't quite earned, Greg also understood something fundamental about his father: **Vic breaks rules to advance people**. Not for himself — for *other people*. His son. His students. The kid across the street. If someone was one point short, one step behind, one push away from making it — Vic would provide the push. Every time. Without hesitation.

Greg wore the medal without a second thought. Not because the score was right, but because the man behind it was.

### The Pusher

That instinct — *I will get you across the finish line* — is the thread that runs through everything Vic did as a father:

- He pushed **Rich** across the finish line with his schooling — the kind of sustained, daily, unglamorous parental pressure that doesn't make the highlight reel but makes the diploma possible.
- He helped **Yvonne** when she went back to advance her teaching credentials — supporting her education the same way he supported his students', because the unspoken rule applied to everyone under his roof. Everyone advances. No exceptions.
- He pushed his students at Long Branch — the grants for computers, the Stock Market Club, the extra effort that turned a business department into a launchpad.

This is the core of Vic's character, and it's more nuanced than "proud dad." He's not just proud of his children's accomplishments. He's *in the engine room* of those accomplishments, pushing, adjusting, occasionally bending a rule when the rule is the only thing standing between someone he loves and the thing they deserve.

Is it always by the book? No. But the man who flew medevac in Vietnam didn't learn his ethics from a book. He learned them from the conviction that **you do whatever it takes to get your people home safe** — and "home safe" includes a marksman medal, a diploma, a teaching credential, and a career.

## The Proud Dad

Vic's emails to his children reveal a father who is present, emotional, and endlessly proud. When Greg shared career milestones — a promotion at GSK, the AbbVie offer, the Research Fellow announcement — Vic responded immediately, warmly, and with his whole heart:

> "Dearest Son, I hope you can take a long breath and exhale!!!! Congratulations for a job well done. I hope it satisfied all your expectations. It looks like a great start. The Lord has blessed you once more. Here's a big hug and a kiss."

That's Vic: faith, pride, physical affection, and exclamation marks. In the same email, he mentioned his aunt Yolanda had just died — mixing family joy with family grief in the same breath. That's a man who carries it all.

When Greg was promoted to Research Fellow at AbbVie in 2018, the company-wide announcement — detailing a Ph.D. from the University of Connecticut, a faculty position at Muhlenberg College, a decade at GSK, and pioneering work in clinical statistics — was forwarded straight to Mom and Dad. The son of a public school administrator and a health teacher had become a Research Fellow in drug development. And the first people he told were his parents.

## "Look at yourselves!!!!"

In September 2017, Vic sent a family photo (P1020477.JPG) to Rich, Ellie, and Greg. The subject line: **"Look at yourselves!!!!"** The body: empty. Four exclamation marks said everything.

That's the proud father and grandfather. The man who looks at his family and can barely contain the joy.

**Rich and Greg:** What's the most trouble you got into as kids that you DEFINITELY didn't tell Mom and Dad about at the time? And what's the thing Dad did that was SO embarrassing when you were teenagers but now makes you laugh until you cry?

**Ellie, Anthony, and Richy:** What's the funniest thing Grandpa has ever said? The joke he tells every single time? The face he makes? Don't overthink it — just the first thing that pops into your head.

## The Health Kick

There was a phase — and it was glorious.

Vic and Eve (the family's name for Yvonne) got into **running**. Not jogging-around-the-block running. *Running* running. The kind where you buy the shoes, track the miles, and talk about it at dinner. The health kick swept through the extended family like a fever:

- **Mike Hurley Sr.** and his kids were deep into **weights, martial arts, and aerobics**. The Hurley household was a gym before it was a house.
- **Mike Hurley Jr.** played **football** in school — carrying on the athletic tradition that his uncle Vic had started as "Glue Fingers" in Bayonne.
- **Kathy Pacifico** (Mike and Mary Ann's daughter) turned the family's fitness obsession into a business: **Forum Fitness Club** in Bayonne, which she has run since **1982**. The Elia-Hurley side didn't just exercise — they *institutionalized* exercise.

And the Cicconettis? They went bigger. Vic and Eve organized **family reunion triathlons** — events that brought the whole clan together for swimming, biking, and running. Not professionally. Not competitively (well, maybe a little competitively). But together. Because for this family, even fitness was a group activity. Even a triathlon was a family reunion.

The health kick was real. It was part of the Shore years, part of the fitness culture of the 1980s and '90s, part of two families — Cicconetti and Hurley — that believed in pushing themselves physically the same way they pushed themselves professionally.

**Every decade brought its fashions, its obsessions, and its cultural moments. The Cicconettis lived through all of them:**

**The 1960s** — Bell-bottoms, tie-dye, the British Invasion, muscle cars, and the space race. *The Flintstones* was primetime television. The family watched the moon landing on a black-and-white TV — every American did. JFK's assassination. The Beatles on Ed Sullivan. Woodstock (though Bayonne Italians were not exactly the Woodstock demographic).

**The 1970s** — Disco, leisure suits, the pet rock, mood rings, and the energy crisis. Gas lines. Watergate on television every night. *Star Wars* changed everything in 1977. The Bee Gees were inescapable. Every neighborhood had a kid with a skateboard and a kid with a CB radio. Earth shoes. Macramé plant hangers. The Brady Bunch as aspirational family life.

**The 1980s** — Aerobics, leg warmers, Members Only jackets, Pac-Man, the Walkman, and MTV. Reagan was president and the Berlin Wall came down. *E.T.* made every kid want a bike with a basket. Cabbage Patch Kids caused actual fistfights in stores. The Rubik's Cube. Atari, then Nintendo. Hair got bigger. Shoulder pads got bigger. The fitness craze hit hard — Jane Fonda tapes, Jazzercise, running became a lifestyle, not just exercise. The Cicconettis and Hurleys caught this wave fully.

**The 1990s** — Grunge killed hair metal. Beanie Babies became investment vehicles (they weren't). The Macarena. Fanny packs. Rollerblades. *Seinfeld* and *Friends* defined the decade. The internet arrived — slowly, then all at once. AOL dial-up. "You've got mail." The Y2K panic. Everyone bought a cell phone the size of a brick and felt like James Bond.

**The 2000s** — Reality TV took over (Survivor, American Idol, Jersey Shore — *yes, Jersey Shore*). Facebook launched. The iPhone arrived in 2007 and nothing was ever the same. Crocs. Low-rise jeans. The housing boom, then the crash. Everyone got a GPS and stopped asking for directions. DVDs replaced VHS, then streaming replaced DVDs.

**What stuck:** Through every fad that came and went — pet rocks, Beanie Babies, fidget spinners — the things that lasted in the Cicconetti household were the things that mattered: family dinners, Shore trips, faith, and the belief that you show up for the people you love. The leisure suits went to Goodwill. The family stayed.
:::

## The Family Circle

The Cicconetti family orbit extends beyond the immediate household:

- **Rich's wedding** at Ram's Head Inn (rehearsal January 2018) brought together the core family
- **The 40th anniversary** in 2007 was a family reunion at the Hurley home in Stafford
- **The 75th birthday** in 2021 was coordinated by Kathy Pacifico with a tribute video
- **The 80th birthday** in 2026 — this celebration — brings the circle together again

And through it all, the sign-off never changes:

[Love DAD]{.love-dad}

::: {.callout-note title="Your Turn — Everyone"}
**Rich and Greg:** What's your best Vic story? The one you tell at parties. The one that makes people say "your dad sounds amazing." Write it down — even just a few sentences. It goes straight into this chapter.

**The grandkids:** What's the thing Grandpa always says? What's his best joke? What does he do that cracks you up? What's the thing about him that you'll remember when you're old?

**Everyone:** What are the Vic-isms? The phrases he uses, the habits, the things that are just *so Dad/Grandpa*?

*We already know he signs every email "Love DAD." What else?*

*Three grandchildren. Two sons. Nearly sixty years of marriage. The numbers tell the story of a man whose greatest achievement has always been family.*
