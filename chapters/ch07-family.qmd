*"Look at yourselves!!!!"*
— Vic, sending a family photo to his children, September 2017. Four exclamation marks. No body text needed.

Every family has songs that ARE the family — the ones that trigger memories the moment you hear the first three notes:

**Songs for a Family Man**

- Cat Stevens — "Father and Son"
- Jim Croce — "Time in a Bottle"
- Stevie Wonder — "Isn't She Lovely"
- Louis Armstrong — "What a Wonderful World"
- Van Morrison — "Brown Eyed Girl"
- The Temptations — "My Girl"
- Billy Joel — "Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)"
- Harry Chapin — "Cat's in the Cradle" *(every dad's gut-punch)*
- Springsteen — "Waitin' on a Sunny Day"
- Nat King Cole — "Unforgettable"

*What's the song that IS the Cicconetti family? The one Dad plays every holiday? The one that makes Mom roll her eyes? The one the grandkids associate with Grandpa's house? [Suggest a song.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/YOUR_FORM_ID/viewform)*

::: {.callout-note title="The Italian-American Family: A Different Kind of Institution" collapse="true"}
**The broadest wavelet:** The Italian-American family was never just a family — it was a *system*. A social safety net, an employment agency, a marriage bureau, a banking institution, and a tribunal of justice rolled into one. In the old country, the *famiglia* was the only institution that mattered — the government was distant, the Church was powerful but abstract, and the *padrone* exploited you. Your family fed you, housed you, and protected you.

When Italians came to America, they brought this system with them. Sunday dinners weren't optional. Family decisions were collective. You didn't move away without a reason everyone could accept. You married someone the family approved of (or you eloped and dealt with the consequences). You named your children after your parents and grandparents — a chain of names linking the generations.

By the time Vic and Yvonne were raising their family in the 1970s and 80s, the old-country strictness had softened, but the core values held: **loyalty, proximity, showing up**. The Cicconetti family — two educators, three kids, Shore living — was the Italian-American dream fully realized. Not wealth, but stability. Not fame, but respect. Not distance, but closeness.

## Three Children, Six Grandchildren

At the center of Victor's life is family. He and Yvonne raised **two sons and one daughter** — children who grew up in a household shaped by two educators, Italian-American values, and the quiet strength of parents who had built their lives from scratch.

### Richard "Rich" M. Cicconetti

Rich — born approximately August 1977 — is one of Victor's sons. He studied at **Rutgers University** and has built a career in technology, specializing in form-building solutions through his business, **Cicco Devel**. He and his wife **Sharon** (nee Doughty) live in Galloway, NJ — close to Victor and Yvonne, keeping the family geography tight. Rich represents the next generation: rooted in New Jersey, connected to family, and building something of his own.

Sharon joined the family as Sharon Katherine Doughty. Her father, **Clarence S. "Clancy" Doughty, Jr.**, passed away in July 2024 — a recent loss the family felt deeply.

### The Other Children

Victor and Yvonne's other son and their daughter are part of the family's inner circle. One son is described as having been involved in the family restaurant; the other pursued a career in research.

::: {.callout-warning title="We Need Names!"}
We can't write this chapter properly without the full family roster:

- **All three children** — full names (we only have Rich confirmed)
- **All six grandchildren** — names, ages, and which child they belong to
- **What do the grandkids call him?** Pop-Pop? Grandpa? Nonno? Something only they use?

## The Proud Dad

Vic's emails to his children reveal a father who is present, emotional, and endlessly proud. When Greg shared career milestones — a promotion at GSK, the AbbVie offer, the Research Fellow announcement — Vic responded immediately, warmly, and with his whole heart:

> "Dearest Son, I hope you can take a long breath and exhale!!!! Congratulations for a job well done. I hope it satisfied all your expectations. It looks like a great start. The Lord has blessed you once more. Here's a big hug and a kiss."

That's Vic: faith, pride, physical affection, and exclamation marks. In the same email, he mentioned his aunt Yolanda had just died — mixing family joy with family grief in the same breath. That's a man who carries it all.

When Greg was promoted to Research Fellow at AbbVie in 2018, the company-wide announcement — detailing a Ph.D. from the University of Connecticut, a faculty position at Muhlenberg College, a decade at GSK, and pioneering work in clinical statistics — was forwarded straight to Mom and Dad. The son of a public school administrator and a health teacher had become a Research Fellow in drug development. And the first people he told were his parents.

## "Look at yourselves!!!!"

In September 2017, Vic sent a family photo (P1020477.JPG) to Rich, Natalie, and Greg. The subject line: **"Look at yourselves!!!!"** The body: empty. Four exclamation marks said everything.

That's the proud grandfather. The man who looks at his family and can barely contain the joy.

::: {.callout-tip title="Tell Us a Story"}
**Rich, Greg, and [sister]:** What's the most trouble you got into as kids that you DEFINITELY didn't tell Mom and Dad about at the time? And what's the thing Dad did that was SO embarrassing when you were teenagers but now makes you laugh until you cry?

**Grandkids:** What's the funniest thing Grandpa has ever said? The joke he tells every single time? The face he makes? Don't overthink it — just the first thing that pops into your head.

## The Family Circle

The Cicconetti family orbit extends beyond the immediate household:

- **Rich's wedding** at Ram's Head Inn (rehearsal January 2018) brought together the core family
- **The 40th anniversary** in 2007 was a family reunion at the Hurley home in Stafford
- **The 75th birthday** in 2021 was coordinated by Kathy Pacifico with a tribute video
- **The 80th birthday** in 2026 — this celebration — brings the circle together again

And through it all, the sign-off never changes:

[Love DAD]{.love-dad}

::: {.callout-note title="Your Turn — Everyone"}
**Rich, Greg, and [sister]:** What's your best Vic story? The one you tell at parties. The one that makes people say "your dad sounds amazing." Write it down — even just a few sentences. It goes straight into this chapter.

**The grandkids:** What's the thing Grandpa always says? What's his best joke? What does he do that cracks you up? What's the thing about him that you'll remember when you're old?

**Everyone:** What are the Vic-isms? The phrases he uses, the habits, the things that are just *so Dad/Grandpa*?

*We already know he signs every email "Love DAD." What else?*

*Six grandchildren. Three children. Nearly sixty years of marriage. The numbers tell the story of a man whose greatest achievement has always been family.*
