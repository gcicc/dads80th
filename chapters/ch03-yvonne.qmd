## The Columns Merge

On **August 20, 1967**, Victor R. Cicconetti married **Yvonne C. Elia** at **Assumption Catholic Church in Bayonne, New Jersey**.

He was twenty-one. She was nineteen. The Vietnam War was raging — Victor was in the middle of his Air Force service. But they chose each other, and from this day forward, the two family lines that had traveled separately from Italy to Bayonne became one story.

It would prove to be the great constant of both their lives.

## A Partnership Built to Last

What makes a marriage last nearly sixty years? The Cicconetti answer, visible in every email Vic sends and every milestone the family celebrates, is this: **two people who show up for each other, every single day, without exception**.

The partnership has weathered:

- **Vietnam-era separation** — newly married, with Victor deployed overseas as a medic
- **Career building** — Victor in school administration (Long Branch, Asbury Park), Yvonne in health education (Jersey City) — two educators under one roof
- **Entrepreneurial risk** — co-owning an Italian restaurant as a family venture
- **Raising three children** — two sons and a daughter
- **Six grandchildren** — four by their 40th anniversary in 2007, two more since
- **Loss** — Victor's parents, his brothers Dennis and Michael, his sister Loretta, Yvonne's father Frank

Through all of it, the partnership held. More than held — it flourished.

**Dad & Mom:** Who made the first move? Who chased who? What did you *really* think of each other on the first date? Come on — you've been married almost sixty years. You can finally tell us.

## How They Operate

Vic's emails reveal a partnership where both voices matter but the rhythm is distinctly theirs. When Greg shared career milestones, Vic responded first — immediate, warm, emotional:

> "Dearest Son, I hope you can take a long breath and exhale!!!! Congratulations for a job well done."

And then the tell:

> "Mommy feels the same way and I am sure she will speak to you."

That's Victor: he speaks with his whole heart, then defers to Yvonne for her own word. He doesn't presume to speak for her. He announces her. Two voices, one team.

## The 40th Anniversary

In **2007**, the family gathered at the home of **Mary Ann and Michael Hurley** in Stafford, NJ, to celebrate Victor and Yvonne's **40th wedding anniversary**. The milestone was marked with a family party and a feature in the *Asbury Park Press* anniversaries section. At the time, they had four grandchildren.

Now, nearly twenty years later, the grandchildren number six, the careers have given way to retirement, and the wedding that began at Assumption Church has become one of the longest-running love stories in the family.

## This Book Is Their Story

From this chapter forward, this book tells the joint story of Victor and Yvonne — with Vic as the lead, because it's his 80th birthday. But make no mistake: every chapter that follows is also Yvonne's story. Every achievement of Vic's was built on the foundation she provided. Every family milestone was celebrated together.

When Yvonne's birthday comes, we'll tell this story again — with her in the spotlight, her career foregrounded, her voice leading. The same partnership, seen from the other side.

For now: this is Vic's turn. And it starts here, at the altar, on August 20, 1967.

This is the chapter we can't write without you. We know the date (August 20, 1967) and the place (Assumption Church). But the *story*?

- **How did you two meet?** Was it a setup? A chance encounter? Did you know right away?
- **What was the wedding like?** Big or small? Who was there? What do you remember most?
- **What was it like being newlyweds with a war on?** Mom, what was it like when Dad was overseas?
- **What's the secret?** Nearly sixty years. What makes it work?
- **Dad:** What would you want to say about Mom in this book?
- **Mom:** What would you want to say about Dad?

*This chapter will only be as good as what you give us. And we want it to be the best chapter in the book.*

*From this day forward, the two columns become one. The Cicconetti-Elia story is a partnership — and it has lasted nearly sixty years and counting.*
