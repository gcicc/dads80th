# The Family Table {#restaurant}

::: {.chapter-epigraph}
*The Cicconetti love of food goes back to Collepietro. But it took an Italian restaurant in New Jersey to turn family tradition into a family business.*

Every Italian restaurant has a soundtrack. The kitchen runs on rhythm. The dining room runs on mood. This is what probably filled the Cicconetti restaurant:

**The broadest wavelet:** When the first Italian immigrants arrived, they ate to survive — peasant food adapted to what was available in America. Olive oil was hard to find, so they used lard. They couldn't get the specific greens from the old country, so they adapted recipes. Italian-American cooking — meatballs and spaghetti, chicken parmigiana, baked ziti — isn't really "Italian food." It's the food of immigrants making do, then making it their own, then making it *legendary*.

By the 1970s and 80s, the Italian-American restaurant was an American institution. Every Jersey Shore town had at least one. The red-sauce joints, the pizza parlors, the "gravy" vs. "sauce" debates that could split a family. This was the food culture the Cicconettis lived and breathed.

**The Jersey wavelet:** New Jersey's Italian food scene is arguably the best in America outside of New York City. From the tomato pie shops of Trenton to the pork stores of Newark's Ironbound to the Shore restaurants in Long Branch, Belmar, and Point Pleasant — Italian food IS New Jersey food. When the Cicconettis opened their restaurant, they weren't just starting a business. They were joining a tradition as deep as the state itself.

## An Italian Restaurant — A Family Venture

Victor's energy never stayed in one lane. At some point in their journey, he and Yvonne took their Italian heritage from the family kitchen to the business world. Together with **one of their sons**, they **co-owned and operated an Italian restaurant** — a venture that combined family, food, and the entrepreneurial spirit.

The restaurant represented something deeply personal: the Cicconetti family's Italian-American roots brought to life through cuisine, hospitality, and the shared effort of multiple generations working together. From the Abruzzese kitchens of Collepietro to the industrial waterfront of Bayonne to a restaurant table in New Jersey — the food carried the family story forward.

Running a restaurant is one of the most demanding small-business ventures there is. Long hours, tight margins, constant attention to quality and customer experience. Doing it as a family adds another layer — the intimacy of working alongside your spouse and your son, day after day, meal after meal.

## Food as Heritage

For Italian-American families, food is never just food. It's memory. It's identity. It's the thread that connects a grandmother's kitchen in the old country to a Sunday dinner table in New Jersey. The Cicconettis' restaurant venture was an expression of that heritage — a public declaration of who they were and where they came from.

**Dad & Mom:** We know almost NOTHING about the restaurant. What was it called? What was the dish people drove across town for? What's the funniest thing that happened in that kitchen? Who burned what? Who cried? Was there a regular customer you still remember by name?

**The son who ran the kitchen:** What was it like working with your parents every single day? What's the one story from the restaurant that you always tell?

## The Elia Side: Mary Ann's Pizza Bistro

The entrepreneurial food spirit ran on both sides of the family. Yvonne's sister **Mary Ann Hurley** (nee Elia) also ran a **pizza bistro in Bayonne** — keeping the Italian-American food tradition alive in the neighborhood where she and Yvonne grew up.

Two sisters. Two restaurants. Two families carrying the same tradition forward. The dinner table was always at the center.

::: {.callout-note title="Your Turn — This Chapter Is Almost Empty Without You"}
We know you ran an Italian restaurant together. That's about all we know. This chapter needs YOU more than any other.

**Dad & Mom:**

- What was the restaurant called? Where was it?
- Whose idea was it? How did it start?
- What were the signature dishes? What was the thing people came back for?
- What was the best night? The worst night?
- What did you learn about each other from working together?

**The son who was in the kitchen:** What was it like working with your parents every day? What's the story you tell people when they ask about the restaurant?

**Aunt Mary Ann:** What was your pizza bistro called? Was there a friendly rivalry between the two family restaurants?

*An Italian-American family that runs a restaurant together — this chapter should practically write itself. But only if you talk.*

*Not every family turns their heritage into a business. The Cicconettis did — and the family table got a whole lot bigger.*
