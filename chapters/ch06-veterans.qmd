*Victor forwarded "The Gift of Time" — a parable about Alexander the Great's deathbed wishes — to his sons and his brother-in-law. The lesson: time is the most precious gift. Vic lives that lesson through the time he gives to fellow veterans.*

The songs that mean something to veterans: "Born in the U.S.A." (Springsteen), "Fortunate Son" (CCR), "Coming Home" (Cinderella), "Brothers in Arms" (Dire Straits). The music of service and homecoming.

## Vietnam Veterans of America Chapter 12

Victor's deepest community commitment has been to his fellow veterans. As a **founding member and president of Vietnam Veterans of America Chapter 12** in Ocean Township, NJ, he helped build an organization dedicated to the men and women who served in Vietnam.

The founding of VVA Chapter 12 was a natural extension of Victor's character: the same man who flew medical evacuations to save lives in Southeast Asia continued serving his fellow veterans at home. It was not enough to have served; Victor felt a duty to make sure that those who served alongside him were never forgotten.

VVA Chapter 12 was — and remains — part of a national movement to ensure that Vietnam-era veterans are:

- **Recognized** for their service and sacrifice
- **Supported** with resources, advocacy, and practical assistance
- **Connected** to a community that understands their experience

The chapter gave veterans something that was in short supply when they came home from Vietnam: a place where their service was honored, their experiences were understood, and their needs were advocated for.

## Life Memberships

Victor holds **life memberships** in:

- **Veterans Affairs (VA)**
- **Disabled American Veterans (DAV)**

These are not honorary titles. They reflect decades of active participation in the veteran community — showing up, advocating, and giving time to the cause that mattered most to him beyond family.

**Dad:** What was the first Chapter 12 meeting like? Was it in someone's living room? A VFW hall? A bar? Who showed up, and what made you think *"this is something real"*?

**Fellow veterans:** What's the Vic Cicconetti story you tell when he's not in the room? The one that captures who he really is as a leader and a friend?

## The Forward Network

Vic's veteran connections show up in the most personal places. His email forward list — the circle of people he shares life wisdom with — includes fellow veterans and Bayonne-era friends: Leon, David Connelly, Larry Messina, and others. These are the men he sends chain emails about life philosophy, the Gift of Time, and the things that matter.

In November 2015, Vic forwarded to Greg, Rich, and Mike Hurley a parable about Alexander the Great's dying wishes — the message being that worldly achievements pale next to the gift of time well spent. That's the kind of thing Vic curates and shares: not just jokes or politics, but *meaning*.

His veteran circle is his brotherhood. For Vic, the uniform came off in 1969, but the bond of service never did.

::: {.callout-note title="Your Turn — Dad"}
You founded VVA Chapter 12. We don't know when, and we don't know the full story.

- What year did you start the chapter? What pushed you to do it?
- Who were the other founders? Are any of them still around?
- What were the chapter's biggest accomplishments?
- Is Chapter 12 still active?
- What does veteran advocacy mean to you — really? Not the official version. The personal one.

**Fellow veterans — Leon, David Connelly, Larry Messina, and the rest of the forward list:** If you're reading this, Vic doesn't know about this book. What would you want to say about him? What kind of leader was he? Send your stories — they'll go right into this chapter.

*Victor's commitment to his fellow veterans is the thread that runs through his entire adult life — from the medevac flights of his twenties to the advocacy work of his seventies. It is, perhaps, his longest-running mission.*
