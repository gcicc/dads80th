# Serving Those Who Served {#veterans}

::: {.chapter-epigraph}
*Victor forwarded "The Gift of Time" — a parable about Alexander the Great's deathbed wishes — to his sons and his brother-in-law. The lesson: time is the most precious gift. Vic lives that lesson through the time he gives to fellow veterans.*

::: {.callout-note title="The Long Road to Recognition: Vietnam Veterans in America" collapse="true"}
**The wide lens:** Vietnam veterans came home to a country that didn't want to look at them. No parades. No ticker tape. Many were spat on, called baby killers, told to take off the uniform. The government that sent them to war treated them as a political embarrassment. Agent Orange exposure was denied for decades. PTSD wasn't even recognized as a diagnosis until **1980** — eleven years after the last troops came home.

The numbers were staggering: **58,220 Americans killed**. Over **300,000 wounded**. An estimated **700,000** veterans suffering from PTSD. And for years, the country looked away.

**The turning point:** On **November 13, 1982**, the **Vietnam Veterans Memorial** was dedicated on the National Mall — Maya Lin's black granite wall inscribed with every name. Tens of thousands of veterans gathered in Washington. Many wept openly. For the first time, the country was saying: *we see you*.

That same year, the **Vietnam Veterans of America** was officially chartered by Congress. Chapters began forming across the country — grassroots organizations built by the veterans themselves, for themselves. No one was going to advocate for them if they didn't do it themselves.

**The New Jersey lens:** New Jersey sent over **170,000 men and women** to Vietnam — one of the highest per-capita rates in the nation. The state's working-class cities — Bayonne, Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, Trenton — bore the heaviest burden. By the 1980s, NJ veterans were organizing, forming VVA chapters, pushing for recognition and services. The **New Jersey Vietnam Veterans' Memorial** in Holmdel was dedicated in **1995** — a 200-foot-long black granite wall overlooking the Garden State Parkway.

**The close-up:** This is where Vic stepped in. He didn't wait for someone else to build it. He helped found **VVA Chapter 12** in Ocean Township — creating, from scratch, the community that the country had failed to provide. The medic who healed in Vietnam was still healing at home.

## Vietnam Veterans of America Chapter 12

Victor's deepest community commitment has been to his fellow veterans. As a **founding member and president of Vietnam Veterans of America Chapter 12** in Ocean Township, NJ, he helped build an organization dedicated to the men and women who served in Vietnam.

The founding of VVA Chapter 12 was a natural extension of Victor's character: the same man who flew medical evacuations to save lives in Southeast Asia continued serving his fellow veterans at home. It was not enough to have served; Victor felt a duty to make sure that those who served alongside him were never forgotten.

VVA Chapter 12 was — and remains — part of a national movement to ensure that Vietnam-era veterans are:

- **Recognized** for their service and sacrifice
- **Supported** with resources, advocacy, and practical assistance
- **Connected** to a community that understands their experience

The chapter gave veterans something that was in short supply when they came home from Vietnam: a place where their service was honored, their experiences were understood, and their needs were advocated for.

## Life Memberships

Victor holds **life memberships** in:

- **Veterans Affairs (VA)**
- **Disabled American Veterans (DAV)**

These are not honorary titles. They reflect decades of active participation in the veteran community — showing up, advocating, and giving time to the cause that mattered most to him beyond family.

**Dad:** What was the first Chapter 12 meeting like? Was it in someone's living room? A VFW hall? A bar? Who showed up, and what made you think *"this is something real"*?

**Fellow veterans:** What's the Vic Cicconetti story you tell when he's not in the room? The one that captures who he really is as a leader and a friend?

## The Parade

Vic was active in **Vietnam veteran parades** — marching with his brothers from VVA Chapter 12, in formation, with pride. For a generation that came home to silence, every parade was a reclamation. Every step said: *we served, we're here, and we're not ashamed*.

But there's one parade image that captures something deeper than veteran pride. Picture this:

**Victor Cicconetti, Vietnam veteran, marching with his fellow vets** — and in the same parade, in a different formation, **his sons marching in NJROTC uniforms** with the **Marine Academy of Science and Technology (MAST)**.

MAST — the elite magnet school at Sandy Hook, part of the Monmouth County Vocational School District — combined rigorous STEM academics with Naval ROTC discipline. The Cicconetti boys were there, in uniform, marching in the same parade as their father.

Think about what Vic saw when he looked across that parade route: his own journey reflected back at him. A Vietnam veteran medic who came home and built a life — and now his sons, in uniform, getting the education and discipline that would launch them into their own careers. The immigrant bet, compounding again. Three generations from Collepietro to NJROTC dress whites.

That was a point of pride that went beyond the parade. That was the whole project — the whole family mission — made visible in a single afternoon on a Jersey Shore boulevard.

## The Forward Network

Vic's veteran connections show up in the most personal places. His email forward list — the circle of people he shares life wisdom with — includes fellow veterans and Bayonne-era friends: Leon, David Connelly, Larry Messina, and others. These are the men he sends chain emails about life philosophy, the Gift of Time, and the things that matter.

In November 2015, Vic forwarded to Greg, Rich, and Mike Hurley a parable about Alexander the Great's dying wishes — the message being that worldly achievements pale next to the gift of time well spent. That's the kind of thing Vic curates and shares: not just jokes or politics, but *meaning*.

His veteran circle is his brotherhood. For Vic, the uniform came off in 1969, but the bond of service never did.

*Victor's commitment to his fellow veterans is the thread that runs through his entire adult life — from the medevac flights of his twenties to the advocacy work of his seventies. It is, perhaps, his longest-running mission.*
