# Two Families, One City {#roots}

::: {.chapter-epigraph}
*In the early 1900s, two families left southern Italy — one from the mountains of Abruzzo, one from the hills of Campania. They crossed the Atlantic, passed through Ellis Island, and landed in the same small city on the New Jersey waterfront. They didn't know each other yet. But their grandchildren would marry, and this story would begin.*

Vic grew up in Bayonne in the 1950s — fifteen minutes from Newark, the doo-wop capital of the world. This is what was coming out of every transistor radio, corner candy store, and church dance in his neighborhood:

**Doo-Wop (the sound of Bayonne)**

- Dion & The Belmonts — "A Teenager in Love" / "Runaround Sue"
- The Four Seasons — "Sherry" / "Big Girls Don't Cry" *(Frankie Valli = Jersey royalty)*
- The Drifters — "Under the Boardwalk" *(the Jersey Shore anthem)*
- The Flamingos — "I Only Have Eyes for You"
- The Platters — "The Great Pretender" / "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"
- Frankie Lymon & The Teenagers — "Why Do Fools Fall in Love"
- Danny & The Juniors — "At the Hop"
- The Del-Vikings — "Come Go with Me"

**The Italian-American Crooners (what the parents played)**

- Dean Martin — "That's Amore" / "Volare"
- Frank Sinatra — "Fly Me to the Moon" / "I've Got You Under My Skin"
- Perry Como — "Magic Moments" / "Catch a Falling Star"
- Connie Francis — "Who's Sorry Now" *(she's from Newark!)*
- Louis Prima — "Just a Gigolo" / "Buona Sera"
- Bobby Darin — "Beyond the Sea" / "Mack the Knife"

## From Italy to Bayonne

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="48%"}

### The Cicconettis

**Origin:** Collepietro, Province of L'Aquila, Abruzzo — a stone village perched at 2,785 feet in the Apennine Mountains, fewer than 200 inhabitants even today.

**The name:** Cicconetti derives from *Franciscus* ("a free man") through Italian diminutives: Francesco → Cicco → Cicconetti — "little Cicco." Documented in Collepietro since at least **1778**, when **Camillo Giovanni Cicconetti** married Maria Consiglia Iannarelli.

**Why they left:** Between 1880 and 1920, half a million Abruzzesi left Italy. The soil was thin, the winters harsh, inheritance laws fragmented the land. Young men traveled down from the mountains to Naples, boarded steamships, crossed the Atlantic in steerage, and passed through Ellis Island.

**Where they landed:** Bayonne, New Jersey — a city of oil refineries and shipyards on a narrow peninsula jutting into New York Harbor. By 1920, Italians constituted over 20% of the population. The Cicconettis settled among other Abruzzese *paesani*, near **Assumption Catholic Church**.

### The Elias & Chiarolanzas

**Origin:** The Elia surname traces to southern Italy — most concentrated in **Puglia**, with presence in Calabria, Campania, and Sicily. Yvonne's mother Mary carried the surname **Chiarolanza** (Americanized to "Chirolanza") — a rare name meaning **"Bright Lance"** (*chiara* + *lanza*), rooted in **Montecorvino Rovella, Province of Salerno, Campania**.

**The crossing:** The 1940 Census found **Mary Chiarolanza, age 20**, in Bayonne with her father **Alfonso**, mother **Angelina**, and **four sisters**. They had emigrated from Campania and passed through Ellis Island.

**Where they landed:** The same city. Bayonne. The Elia family settled near **Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church** (established 1899) — the heart of the Italian community, just blocks from the Cicconettis. Mary Chiarolanza went to work as a **seamstress at the Maidenform factory** at 154 Avenue E — Bayonne's largest employer, where Italian-American women sewed garments (and during WWII, parachutes and carrier pigeon vests).

**Frank Elia** — who worked as a poultry processor in Bayonne's live markets — married Mary Chiarolanza.

## The American Generation

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="48%"}

### Victor Sr. & Eleanor

**Victor Cicconetti Sr.** was born in Bayonne in **1925** — a son of the immigrant generation. He married **Eleanor Salone**, one of three sisters (Marge, Eleanor, Josie) raised on the **Lower East Side of Manhattan**. Their parents were **Joseph (Giuseppe) Salone** and **Anna (Nunziana Castro) Salone**.

During the Depression, all three Salone sisters spent time in an **orphanage** until their mother Anna found work as a sweatshop seamstress and brought them home. Eleanor eventually followed her sister Marge to Bayonne — the classic pattern of one sibling establishing a foothold and others following.

Victor Sr. and Eleanor raised **six children** in Bayonne:

- **Victor R.** (~1946)
- **Dennis** (deceased)
- **Rev. Leanora** (~1958)
- **Robert "Bob"**
- **Loretta** (d. ~2025)
- **Michael C.** (1961–2009)

Victor Sr. died in **1980** at ~55. Eleanor followed in **1997**.

### Frank & Mary Elia

**Frank Elia** and **Mary** (nee Chiarolanza) raised their children in Bayonne:

- **Yvonne C. Elia** (~1948)
- **Mary Ann Elia** (later Hurley)
- And others in the extended family circle

But tragedy struck around **1962**: Frank died, leaving Yvonne fatherless at about **fourteen years old**. It was a loss that shaped everything about who Yvonne would become — resilient, caring, fiercely devoted to family.

After Frank's death, Mary married **Anthony Galella** — a man who became a beloved stepfather. His impact was lasting enough that Greg would one day name his own son Anthony in his honor.

Mary Ann married **Michael Hurley Sr.**, who rose to the rank of **Captain** in the Bayonne Police Department. Their daughter Kathy Pacifico has run Forum Fitness Club in Bayonne since 1982. Their son Mike Jr. was honored in 2023 for donating World Trade Center steel for the city's 9/11 memorial.

**Anyone who remembers Victor Sr. and Eleanor:** What were they really like? As parents? As a couple? What's the story the family always tells about them?

**Anyone who remembers Frank Elia or Anthony Galella:** Same question — who were these men beyond what the records can tell us?

In this same small city — a 1.2-square-mile peninsula where everyone lived within a fifteen-block radius — two Italian-American families were raising the next generation. Their churches were blocks apart. Their neighborhoods overlapped. Their values were the same: hard work, family loyalty, Catholic faith, and the conviction that America offered what the old country never could.

A boy named Victor was growing up on one block. A girl named Yvonne was growing up on another.

They didn't know it yet. But they were heading toward each other.

::: {.callout-note title="Your Turn"}
**Dad:** We wrote about Bayonne in the 1940s and 50s — but you *lived* it. What do you actually remember? What was the neighborhood like? Who were the characters? What did you eat? Where did you play? What did your parents' house smell like? What would you want your grandkids to know about growing up Cicconetti in Bayonne?

**Mom:** Same question from the Elia side. What was your Bayonne like? What do you remember about your father Frank? About your mother's sewing at Maidenform? About the neighborhood around Mt. Carmel Church?

**Aunt Leanora:** You've been researching the family tree. What do you know that we got wrong — or missed entirely?
