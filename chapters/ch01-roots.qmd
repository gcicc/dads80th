# Two Families, One City {#roots}

::: {.chapter-epigraph}
*In the early 1900s, two families left southern Italy — one from the mountains of Abruzzo, one from the hills of Campania. They crossed the Atlantic, passed through Ellis Island, and landed in the same small city on the New Jersey waterfront. They didn't know each other yet. But their grandchildren would marry, and this story would begin.*

Vic grew up in Bayonne in the 1950s — fifteen minutes from Newark, the doo-wop capital of the world. This is what was coming out of every transistor radio, corner candy store, and church dance in his neighborhood:

::: {.callout-note title="The World Vic Was Born Into (1946)" collapse="true"}
**Consider what a Bayonne household looked like the year Victor Cicconetti was born:**

The family had a **rotary telephone** — one, on the wall, shared by the whole house. Long distance cost real money, so you kept it short. The **radio** was the center of entertainment: Jack Benny, The Shadow, the evening news. If the family had a **television** at all, it arrived around 1948–50 — a small screen, black and white, three channels if you were lucky, and you adjusted the rabbit ears by hand. The **icebox** was transitioning to an electric refrigerator. Clothes went through a **wringer washer** — no dryer, they hung on the line. Dad drove a car with a manual choke, no seatbelts, no power steering. Mom cooked on a gas stove and preserved food by canning.

There was no air conditioning. No microwave. No answering machine. No calculator — you did math by hand or with a slide rule. A "computer" was a room-sized machine at a university. The ballpoint pen had just been invented. Frozen dinners didn't exist yet. Neither did the interstate highway system, the polio vaccine, or rock and roll.

**This is the world Victor was born into.** By the time he turns 80, he will have lived through:

- **Rotary phone → smartphone** (1946 → now)
- **Three TV channels → 500 channels → streaming** (1950 → 1990 → 2015)
- **Slide rule → pocket calculator → laptop → AI** (1946 → 1972 → 1990 → 2023)
- **Vinyl records → 8-track → cassette → CD → MP3 → Spotify** (every format, in order)
- **Handwritten letters → email → text → FaceTime** (the entire arc of communication)
- **No commercial flights → moon landing → Space Shuttle → Mars rovers** (1946 → 1969 → 1981 → 2021)

No generation in human history witnessed more technological change in a single lifetime than the one born in the mid-1940s. Vic didn't just watch it happen — he embraced it. He was the teacher who wrote grants for Commodore computers when other educators thought it was a fad. He was the dad who had a VIC-20 in the house in 1982. He was the man who, at 79, forwards emails from his desktop and uses his phone to stay in touch with grandchildren spread across the country.

The distance from a Bayonne icebox to a smartphone in your pocket — that's one lifetime. That's *his* lifetime.

## The Great Departure

::: {.callout-note title="The Bigger Picture: Why 4 Million Italians Left" collapse="true"}
**The broadest wavelet:** Between 1880 and 1924, over **four million Italians** emigrated to the United States — the largest single-nationality migration in American history. They were overwhelmingly from the *Mezzogiorno* (the south): Campania, Calabria, Sicily, Abruzzo, Puglia. Italy had unified in 1861, but unification made things worse for the south. Northern industrialists taxed southern agriculture to fund northern factories. Inheritance laws divided farms into smaller and smaller plots until a family couldn't feed itself on what it owned.

**Push factors:** Poverty. Malaria. Cholera. Earthquakes (Messina, 1908: 75,000 dead). A feudal land system that hadn't changed in centuries. The *contadini* (peasant farmers) had no path forward.

**Pull factors:** American industry needed labor. Steel mills, coal mines, railroads, oil refineries, garment factories — all of it demanded bodies willing to work for wages that, while pitiful by American standards, dwarfed anything available in a stone village in the Apennines. Letters home from relatives already in America — the *lettere di richiamo* — described a world where work was hard but food was plentiful and a man could own a house.

**The numbers:** In peak years (1900–1914), over 200,000 southern Italians arrived annually at Ellis Island. The flow was so enormous that entire villages depopulated. Collepietro — the Cicconetti homeland — has fewer than 200 residents today.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="The Journey: Steerage Class to Ellis Island" collapse="true"}
**The mid wavelet — what the crossing actually looked like:**

The journey began with a walk. From mountain villages like Collepietro, families traveled by mule or on foot to the nearest rail station, then by train to **Naples** — the great embarkation port for southern Italians. There, emigration agents processed their paperwork and sold them passage.

**The ship:** Steerage class. The cheapest tickets (roughly $30 — about $1,000 today). Passengers were packed below the waterline in open compartments with tiered metal bunks, no ventilation, and one toilet per hundred people. The crossing took **12 to 17 days**. Seasickness was universal. Many had never seen the ocean before boarding.

**Ellis Island:** The Statue of Liberty appeared first — most immigrants saw her from the deck of the ship, crowded against the railing. Then the ferry to Ellis Island. Then the **Great Hall**: a vast, echoing room where thousands waited in metal-railed lines, clutching their documents.

The inspection had three stages:

1. **Medical exam** — Doctors watched immigrants climb the stairs to the Great Hall, looking for limps, labored breathing, signs of disease. The dreaded **"buttonhook men"** used a small hook to flip back eyelids, checking for trachoma (an eye disease that meant automatic deportation). A chalk mark on your coat — **X** for mental deficiency, **H** for heart, **L** for limp — sent you to a detention room.

2. **Legal inspection** — An officer asked 29 questions: name, age, occupation, final destination, how much money you carried (you needed at least $25), whether anyone was meeting you, whether you'd ever been in prison. Interpreters translated. The whole interview lasted about two minutes.

3. **The Staircase of Separation** — Three aisles. Left: New York. Center: detained for further review. Right: New Jersey ferry. Families who'd survived the crossing together could be separated here in an instant.

**The success rate:** About **98%** of immigrants who reached Ellis Island were admitted. But that 2% rejection rate — roughly 250,000 people between 1892 and 1924 — meant that every person in that line knew it could happen to them. Ellis Island's Italian nickname was *L'Isola delle Lacrime* — **the Island of Tears**.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="US Immigration Policy: The Door Opens, Then Closes" collapse="true"}
**The policy wavelet:**

- **1882:** First federal immigration law. Barred "lunatics, idiots, and persons likely to become a public charge."
- **1892:** Ellis Island opens as the federal immigration station. Before this, states ran their own processing (Castle Garden in Manhattan handled New York).
- **1907:** Peak year — **1.25 million immigrants** processed through Ellis Island. Over 100 nationalities. The building was designed for 500,000.
- **1917:** Literacy test required. Immigrants had to read 30–40 words in their native language. This hit southern Italians hard — many were illiterate.
- **1921:** Emergency Quota Act. First numerical limit on immigration. Capped each nationality at 3% of its 1910 Census population in the US.
- **1924:** Johnson-Reed Act. **Slashed quotas to 2% of the 1890 Census** — deliberately targeting southern and eastern Europeans. Italian immigration dropped from 200,000/year to under 4,000. The door slammed shut.

The Cicconettis and the Chiarolanzas made it through before the door closed. Had they waited a decade, this story would never have happened.

## From Italy to Bayonne

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="48%"}

### The Cicconettis

**Origin:** Collepietro, Province of L'Aquila, Abruzzo — a stone village perched at 2,785 feet in the Apennine Mountains, fewer than 200 inhabitants even today.

**The name:** Cicconetti derives from *Franciscus* ("a free man") through Italian diminutives: Francesco → Cicco → Cicconetti — "little Cicco." Documented in Collepietro since at least **1778**, when **Camillo Giovanni Cicconetti** married Maria Consiglia Iannarelli.

**The pronunciation — and the war over it:** In Italian, Cicconetti is pronounced with a hard *ch*: **"Chee-ko-NET-tee."** That's how the old country said it. That's how part of the family still says it. But Vic was adamant: the name gets the **Americanized soft C** — **"Sih-ko-NET-tee."**

It wasn't vanity. It was survival. Growing up in Bayonne, a kid with a name that started with "Chick-" was a sitting duck. *"Hey, Chicken Head, get over here!"* — the playground taunts that Italian-American kids absorbed like body blows. Every strange surname was ammunition. Every rolled R was a target. The children of immigrants learned fast: you either Americanize or you fight every single day.

Vic chose to Americanize. The soft C was a declaration: *I am from here. This is my country. Say my name the way I tell you to say it.* It was the same instinct that drove the whole immigrant project — don't just arrive, *belong*. Don't just survive, *assimilate*. And if the old-country pronunciation has to bend to make that happen, then it bends.

To this day, the family is split. Some Cicconettis use the Italian pronunciation. Some use Vic's Americanized version. It's a tiny civil war that plays out every time someone new asks, "How do you say your last name?" — and the answer depends on which branch you're talking to.

**Why they left:** Between 1880 and 1920, half a million Abruzzesi left Italy. The soil was thin, the winters harsh, inheritance laws fragmented the land. Young men traveled down from the mountains to Naples, boarded steamships, crossed the Atlantic in steerage, and passed through Ellis Island.

**Where they landed:** Bayonne, New Jersey — a city of oil refineries and shipyards on a narrow peninsula jutting into New York Harbor. By 1920, Italians constituted over 20% of the population. The Cicconettis settled among other Abruzzese *paesani*, near **Assumption Catholic Church**.

::: {.column width="48%"}

### The Elias & Chiarolanzas

**Origin:** The Elia surname traces to southern Italy — most concentrated in **Puglia**, with presence in Calabria, Campania, and Sicily. Yvonne's mother Mary carried the surname **Chiarolanza** (Americanized to "Chirolanza") — a rare name meaning **"Bright Lance"** (*chiara* + *lanza*), rooted in **Montecorvino Rovella, Province of Salerno, Campania**.

**The crossing:** The 1940 Census found **Mary Chiarolanza, age 20**, in Bayonne with her father **Alfonso**, mother **Angelina**, and **four sisters**. They had emigrated from Campania and passed through Ellis Island.

**Where they landed:** The same city. Bayonne. The Elia family settled near **Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church** (established 1899) — the heart of the Italian community, just blocks from the Cicconettis. Mary Chiarolanza went to work as a **seamstress at the Maidenform factory** at 154 Avenue E — Bayonne's largest employer, where Italian-American women sewed garments (and during WWII, parachutes and carrier pigeon vests).

**Frank Elia** — who worked as a poultry processor in Bayonne's live markets — married Mary Chiarolanza.

:::

::: {.callout-note title="Bayonne: Why Here?" collapse="true"}
**The local wavelet — why two Italian families ended up on this specific peninsula:**

Bayonne, New Jersey sits on a narrow spit of land between Newark Bay and New York Harbor — 1.2 square miles, surrounded by water on three sides. In the early 1900s, it was an industrial powerhouse: **Standard Oil** had its largest refinery here (the smell of petroleum was the smell of the city), **Maidenform** sewed bras and girdles (and during WWII, parachutes), and shipyards along the Kill Van Kull built vessels for the Navy.

Industry meant jobs. Jobs meant immigrants. By 1920, Bayonne was over **20% Italian**, with clusters from specific regions: Abruzzesi near Assumption Church, Campanians near Our Lady of Mount Carmel. This wasn't random — it was **chain migration**. One man from Collepietro gets a job at the refinery, writes a letter home, and his cousin follows. Then his cousin's cousin. Within a generation, an entire village has relocated to a ten-block radius in New Jersey.

The Italian neighborhoods had their own economy: bakeries, butchers, live poultry markets (where Frank Elia worked), vegetable gardens in tiny backyards, wine made in basements. The old people spoke Italian; the children spoke English at school and Italian at home. The church was the center of everything — feast days, weddings, funerals, Sunday Mass, the social calendar of a community that had transplanted itself 4,000 miles but kept its roots.

## The Unspoken Rule

Nobody sat you down and explained it. There was no speech, no family meeting, no written contract. But every Italian-American kid who grew up in a house like the Cicconettis' or the Elias' understood the deal — it was in the air, in the way your parents looked at you, in the silence after a bad report card, in the pride that radiated off them when you did something right:

**You better be advancing this family.**

That was the immigrant mentality, and it wasn't optional. Your grandparents left everything — their village, their language, their parents' graves — and crossed an ocean in steerage so that *you* could have more than they did. Your parents worked jobs that broke their bodies — refineries, factories, poultry markets, sewing machines — so that *you* wouldn't have to. The debt was enormous, and it was repaid in one currency: **progress**.

Every generation was expected to climb higher than the last:

- The **first generation** (the immigrants) did the crossing. They survived. They got jobs, learned enough English to function, and kept their families fed. That was the mission, and it was enough.
- The **second generation** (Victor Sr., Frank Elia, Eleanor, Mary) was supposed to stabilize. Own a house. Stay out of trouble. Raise children who spoke English without an accent. Send them to school. Get them further from the boat.
- The **third generation** (Vic, Yvonne) was supposed to *arrive*. Get educated. Get a career — not a job, a *career*. Become professionals. Become Americans who nobody could look down on. And then raise children who went even further.

This wasn't pressure in the way modern parenting books describe pressure. It was deeper than that. It was *identity*. You didn't advance just for yourself — you advanced for every person who came before you, for every sacrifice that made your life possible. When Vic got his education degree, that wasn't just Vic succeeding. That was Collepietro succeeding. That was the steerage crossing paying off. That was the whole project of immigration being *validated*.

And it worked. A poultry processor's daughter married a refinery worker's grandson, and together they produced educators, technologists, and professionals. The immigrant bet — *leave everything, cross the ocean, work until your hands bleed, and trust that the children will rise* — that bet paid off, spectacularly, in the Cicconetti family.

But the mentality never fully left. Even now, even at eighty, Vic's pride in his children's accomplishments — "Dearest Son, I hope you can take a long breath and exhale!!!!" — carries the echo of a grandfather he may never have met, standing on the deck of a steamship, watching the Statue of Liberty appear through the fog, thinking: *this better be worth it*.

It was.

::: {.callout-note title="The Italian-American Political Journey" collapse="true"}
**The broadest wavelet:** The Italian-American political story is one of the great migrations in American electoral history — and it mirrors the family's journey from survival to arrival.

**The FDR era (1930s–1960s):** The first and second generation were **Democrats**, almost universally. FDR's New Deal fed them during the Depression. Social Security, labor protections, public works jobs — these programs were lifelines for immigrant families hanging on by their fingernails. The Democratic Party was the party of the working man, and Italian-Americans were working men. In Bayonne, voting Democratic was as natural as going to Mass.

**The JFK moment (1960):** When **John F. Kennedy** won the presidency, Italian-American Catholics wept. A Catholic in the White House. The door was opening. Vic was fourteen. When Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on **November 22, 1963**, Vic was seventeen — old enough to feel it as a personal loss, not just a news event.

**The Reagan shift (1980s):** By the time Vic was a school administrator, the Italian-American political migration was underway. The children and grandchildren of immigrants had *arrived* — they owned homes, had careers, paid taxes, sent their kids to college. The Democratic Party's focus was shifting toward constituencies that didn't look like them. **Ronald Reagan** spoke their language: patriotism, strength, family values, the conviction that America was great because Americans worked hard. The **Reagan Democrat** was born — and in neighborhoods like the ones the Cicconettis came from, the shift was seismic and permanent.

**The personal wavelet:** Vic's politics are his politics, and they're consistent with the man: a veteran who loves his country, a law-and-order believer shaped by the neighborhoods he grew up in, a self-made professional who believes in hard work over handouts. He watches **Fox News**. He listens to **Mark Levin**. He forwards articles and commentaries to his sons and his circle. Yvonne is right there with him — same values, same convictions, same channel.

This isn't a contradiction of the immigrant story. It *is* the immigrant story. The family that crossed the ocean with nothing, worked their way up, and now believes fiercely in the country that made that climb possible — that's a through line as straight as any in this book.

## The American Generation

::: {.callout-note title="The World in 1946: When Victor Was Born" collapse="true"}
Victor was born in the spring of 1946 — the first year of the **Baby Boom**. World War II had ended eight months earlier. His father Victor Sr. was 21, part of the generation that had fought or supported the war effort from the home front. The GI Bill was reshaping America — veterans buying houses, going to college, starting families. Bayonne's refineries and shipyards were converting from wartime production back to commercial work.

In that same year: the **United Nations** held its first session. Churchill delivered the "Iron Curtain" speech. ENIAC, the first general-purpose computer, was unveiled. The world Vic was born into was inventing itself in real time.

By the time Vic was a teenager in the late 1950s, Bayonne was changing. The children and grandchildren of immigrants were moving to the suburbs. The old neighborhoods were thinning. The refineries were modernizing, needing fewer workers. But the values — family, faith, loyalty, the conviction that America rewards hard work — those stayed.
:::

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="48%"}

### Victor Sr. & Eleanor

**Victor Cicconetti Sr.** was born in Bayonne in **1925** — a son of the immigrant generation. He married **Eleanor Salone**, one of three sisters (Marge, Eleanor, Josie) raised on the **Lower East Side of Manhattan**. Their parents were **Joseph (Giuseppe) Salone** and **Anna (Nunziana Castro) Salone**.

During the Depression, all three Salone sisters spent time in an **orphanage** until their mother Anna found work as a sweatshop seamstress and brought them home. Eleanor eventually followed her sister Marge to Bayonne — the classic pattern of one sibling establishing a foothold and others following.

Victor Sr. and Eleanor raised **six children** in Bayonne:

- **Victor R.** (~1946)
- **Dennis** (deceased)
- **Rev. Leanora** (~1958)
- **Robert "Bob"**
- **Loretta** (d. ~2025)
- **Michael C.** (1961–2009)

Victor Sr. struggled with **alcoholism** — a battle that shaped the household and left marks on every child who grew up in it. It was the shadow side of the immigrant story: the pressures of assimilation, of providing, of carrying a family forward in a country that demanded everything and forgave nothing. He died in **1980** at just ~55. Eleanor followed in **1997**.

What Victor Sr. gave his children was complicated — the good and the hard, tangled together. But what his eldest son Vic *did* with that inheritance was unambiguous: he saw what he didn't want to repeat, and he chose differently. That choice would define his life.

### Frank & Mary Elia

**Frank Elia** and **Mary** (nee Chiarolanza) raised their children in Bayonne:

- **Yvonne C. Elia** (~1948)
- **Mary Ann Elia** (later Hurley)
- And others in the extended family circle

But tragedy struck around **1962**: Frank died, leaving Yvonne fatherless at about **fourteen years old**. It was a loss that shaped everything about who Yvonne would become — resilient, caring, fiercely devoted to family.

After Frank's death, Mary married **Anthony Galella** — a man who became a beloved stepfather. His impact was lasting enough that Greg would one day name his own son Anthony in his honor.

Mary Ann married **Michael Hurley Sr.**, who rose to the rank of **Captain** in the Bayonne Police Department. Their daughter Kathy Pacifico has run Forum Fitness Club in Bayonne since 1982. Their son Mike Jr. was honored in 2023 for donating World Trade Center steel for the city's 9/11 memorial.

In this same small city — a 1.2-square-mile peninsula where everyone lived within a fifteen-block radius — two Italian-American families were raising the next generation. Their churches were blocks apart. Their neighborhoods overlapped. Their values were the same: hard work, family loyalty, Catholic faith, and the conviction that America offered what the old country never could.

A boy named Victor was growing up on one block. A girl named Yvonne was growing up on another.

They didn't know it yet. But they were heading toward each other.
