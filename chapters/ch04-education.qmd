## From Battlefield to Classroom

After his military service ended in 1969, Victor built a second career dedicated to a different kind of service: **the education of New Jersey's young people**. He would spend decades as a public school administrator — a career that touched the lives of countless students across some of the state's most dynamic communities.

The transition from Air Force medic to educator was not as unlikely as it might seem. Both roles demanded the same core qualities: patience, discipline, compassion, and the ability to lead under pressure. The young man who had kept wounded soldiers alive during medical evacuations now channeled that same dedication into building futures for students.

## Long Branch High School (1980s)

Victor served as an **administrator at Long Branch High School** during the 1980s — a period when New Jersey's public schools were navigating significant social and demographic changes. Long Branch, a city on the Jersey Shore in Monmouth County, had a diverse student body and a community that valued its schools.

In **1987**, the *Red Bank Register* published a profile of Victor titled **"Man with Many Missions"** — a piece that captured the remarkable breadth of his life experience. The article included a photograph of Victor working at a computer at the school and described him as embodying "an American story," noting his journey from military service through education.

That headline — "Man with Many Missions" — became something of an unofficial motto. It captured Victor's essential nature: a man who never limited himself to a single role, a single community, or a single way of serving.

**Dad:** What was the craziest thing a student ever did? The one you'd come home and tell Mom about, shaking your head? And was there one kid — one student over all those years — who made the whole career worth it?

**Mom:** Two educators under one roof. Did you compare notes at the dinner table? Was there a friendly rivalry over whose school was tougher?

## Asbury Park School District

Victor also worked as a **public school administrator in the Asbury Park school district**, continuing his commitment to students across Monmouth County. Asbury Park — famous for its boardwalk, its music scene, and its complicated history of urban renewal — presented its own challenges and rewards for an educator committed to making a difference.

## Retirement (2000)

After decades of service to New Jersey's young people, Victor **retired in 2000**. His career had taken him through some of the state's most dynamic school communities, and he left behind a legacy of dedication to public education.

### Saint Peter's University Connection

Even in retirement, Victor maintained connections to education. A 2021 **Saint Peter's University** commencement donor/honoree list includes his name — suggesting continued involvement with higher education and community even after stepping away from the daily work.

## Two Educators Under One Roof

It's worth noting that Victor's career in education was shared with Yvonne's. While he administered schools in Long Branch and Asbury Park, she taught health and coordinated programs in Jersey City. Together, they dedicated a combined **half-century** to New Jersey's public school students — approaching education from different angles but with the same underlying commitment.

The son of Italian immigrants, who had served in Vietnam and come home to build a career in the classroom, was doing exactly what his parents' generation had hoped for: turning the immigrant dream into American reality, one student at a time.

We found the 1987 *Red Bank Register* article that called you "Man with Many Missions." Do you remember that interview? Do you still have a copy?

- What made you go into education after Vietnam? Was it always the plan, or did it happen by accident?
- What was Long Branch High School like in the '80s?
- Do you remember specific students who made it all worth it?
- What was a typical day like as an administrator?
- When you retired in 2000, what did you feel? Relief? Loss? Both?

**Mom:** You were teaching health in Jersey City while Dad was in Long Branch. Two educators under one roof — what was that like? Did you compare notes? Compete? Commiserate?

*"Man with Many Missions." The Red Bank Register got it right — and education was the mission that lasted the longest.*
