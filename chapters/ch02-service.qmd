### Victor: Answering the Call

In **1965**, at just nineteen years old, Victor R. Cicconetti joined the **United States Air Force** as a medic. It was an era when young men from neighborhoods like Bayonne answered the call without hesitation. Victor's choice to serve as a medic said something about his character from the start: he went to war not to fight, but to heal.

#### Medical Air Evacuations

Victor's service took him into the skies over Southeast Asia, where he participated in **medical air evacuations** — the critical missions that transported wounded servicemembers from combat zones to medical facilities.

As a medic on these flights, Victor was responsible for keeping patients alive during transport, often under dangerous and chaotic conditions. Medical skill under extreme pressure. Courage in combat zones. Compassion for fellow servicemembers at their most vulnerable.

The nickname **"MedFlyBoy"** — which Vic later used as his Gmail handle — captures both halves of his identity: the **medic** who healed and the **flyboy** who took to the skies. A name born in the Air Force, carried for life.

#### Four Years

From 1965 to 1969, Victor served. He was twenty-three when he came home — no longer the teenager who had left Bayonne, but a man shaped by what he had seen, what he had done, and who he had saved.

Coming home from Vietnam in the late 1960s was its own challenge. The welcome was famously inadequate. But what distinguished Victor was what he did next: he didn't retreat, and he didn't forget.

### Yvonne: Finding Her Strength

While Victor was in Southeast Asia, Yvonne C. Elia was growing up fast in Bayonne.

#### A Father Lost

Around **1962**, when Yvonne was about fourteen, her father **Frank Elia** died. In an instant, the world shifted. The girl who had grown up in the warmth of an Italian-American household — the church, the neighborhood, the family table — now had to find a different kind of strength.

Her mother Mary, the seamstress from Maidenform, held the family together. And when Mary later married **Anthony Galella**, Yvonne gained a stepfather who would earn the family's love so deeply that a grandson would carry his name.

#### Her Own Ambitions

Yvonne channeled her resilience into education. She would go on to build a distinguished career as a **health teacher and coordinator in the Jersey City public school system** — decades of dedicated service to students' wellbeing. After retiring in 2005, she served as an **Allied Health Vocational advisor** for the Hudson County Vocational School District, earning **multiple awards** for connecting young people with healthcare careers.

But that career was still ahead of her. In the mid-1960s, Yvonne was a young woman in Bayonne, shaped by loss but driven by strength, building the foundation of who she would become.

#### Her Sister Mary Ann

Through it all, Yvonne's sister **Mary Ann** was at her side. The bond between the Elia sisters — forged in the shared loss of their father and the strength of their mother — would remain one of the great constants of the extended family. Mary Ann would later marry Michael Hurley, run a pizza bistro in Bayonne, and raise children who would become community pillars in their own right.

**Dad:** Was there one specific moment in Vietnam that changed who you were? And when you landed back in the States — who was the first person you wanted to see?

**Mom:** What did you think when this young man showed up in uniform? Be honest — was it love at first sight, or did he have to work for it?

## Two Paths Converge

By the late 1960s, Victor had returned from Vietnam. Yvonne was finding her way in Bayonne.

Both had been tested. Both had been forged by experience — his by war, hers by loss. Both carried the values of their Italian-American upbringing: faith, family, resilience, and the belief that you show up for the people who need you.

In Bayonne, New Jersey — a city small enough that everyone knew everyone — Victor Cicconetti and Yvonne Elia found each other.

We wrote that you flew medevac missions in Southeast Asia. But we don't know the details — and we'd love to hear whatever you're willing to share.

- Where were you stationed? Which bases?
- What was a typical mission like?
- Do you remember specific flights or patients?
- What was it like coming home in 1969?
- Is "MedFlyBoy" really from the service, or did that come later?

*You don't have to answer all of these. Even one story would make this chapter come alive.*

::: {.callout-note title="Your Turn — Mom"}
We wrote about losing your father at fourteen. We know that shaped you — but only you know how.

- What do you remember about your dad Frank?
- What was it like after he died? How did your mother hold things together?
- When did you know you wanted to go into education?
- What was it like watching Victor leave for Vietnam?
