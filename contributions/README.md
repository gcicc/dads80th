# How to Contribute to Dad's Book

This folder contains templates for each family member to contribute their stories, memories, and corrections to the tribute book. Here's how it works:

## The Process

1. **Pick your template** — there's one for each person / role
2. **Fill it out** — type, dictate, scribble, whatever works. Even one-word answers help.
3. **Send it back to Greg** — email, text, hand it over, whatever
4. **Watch the book change** — your words get woven into the next version

## The Templates

| File | For Who |
|------|---------|
| `vic-and-yvonne.md` | Dad & Mom — the stars of the show |
| `children.md` | Rich, Greg, and [sister] — the kids |
| `grandchildren.md` | All six grandkids |
| `extended-family.md` | Kathy, Mike Jr., Mary Ann, Michael Sr., AJ, Ellie, Frank & Valerie Elia |
| `veterans-and-friends.md` | Fellow veterans, Bayonne friends, colleagues |

## Tips

- **Don't worry about writing perfectly.** We'll clean it up. Just get the stories down.
- **Voice memos work too.** Record yourself talking and send the audio — we'll transcribe it.
- **Correct us!** If we got something wrong in the book, say so. That's the whole point.
- **Short is fine.** Even a single sentence or a single memory is gold.
- **Photos welcome.** If you have photos that go with your story, send those too.

## The Book Evolves

Every contribution makes the book better. Version 1 is what we could piece together from public records, old emails, and research. Version 2 is what happens when the family speaks. The goal: by the time this book is printed, it's not just a biography — it's an autobiography, told in your voices.
