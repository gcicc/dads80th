## Key Corrections to Book

1. **Victor born in NYC** (10th St Ave C), not Bayonne — family moved to Bayonne when Vic was ~10
2. **Air Force started 1964** at Lackland, not 1965 as book states
3. **Shreveport LA 1966-67** and **Thailand 1968** — specific postings not previously known
4. **San Diego 1971** — brief relocation, reason unknown (military-related?)
5. **First owned home:** Avenue E, Bayonne, 1977-1980
6. **Shark River Hills** 1980-1995 — this is when Vic was at Long Branch HS
7. **Wall** 1995-2000 — 4 Rue de la Porte
8. **Neptune** 2000-2020 — 18 Waterview Ave (retirement years, not Galloway)
9. **Blue Heron Pines** 2020-present — 671 Cypress Pt Dr (current home)
10. Book's "Galloway Township and then Egg Harbor City" is partially correct — Blue Heron Pines is in EHC
