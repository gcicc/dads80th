# Extended Family Profiles

*Prepared for Victor R. Cicconetti's 80th Birthday Celebration — March 2026*

---

## Richard "Rich" M. Cicconetti — Son

**Born:** ~August 1977
**Residence:** Galloway, NJ (Atlantic County)
**Education:** Rutgers University
**Spouse:** Sharon K. Cicconetti (nee Doughty)

Rich is one of Victor and Yvonne's sons, carrying the Cicconetti name forward in southern New Jersey. He studied at Rutgers University and has built a career in technology, specializing in form-building solutions. Through his business, Cicco Devel, he designs and optimizes advanced Jotform solutions for clients — a far cry from the classroom and the Air Force, but carrying the same Cicconetti work ethic into the digital age.

Rich and his wife Sharon have made their home in the Galloway area, close to Victor and Yvonne. He is active in the local South Jersey community — the kind of neighbor who posts about found pets and keeps an eye on the neighborhood.

Rich represents the next generation of the Cicconetti family: rooted in New Jersey, connected to family, and building something of his own.

[OWNER INPUT NEEDED: Rich's role in the family restaurant (was he the restaurant son or the drug research son?), favorite memories with Victor, what Rich would say about his dad at 80, his children's names if applicable]

## Sharon K. Cicconetti (nee Doughty) — Daughter-in-law

**Born:** ~May 1974
**Residence:** Galloway, NJ
**Parents:** Clarence S. "Clancy" Doughty, Jr. (d. July 2024) and Margaret "Margie" Dougherty Doughty

Sharon joined the Cicconetti family through her marriage to Rich. Born Sharon Katherine Doughty, she grew up connected to the Doughty family of southern New Jersey. Her father, Clancy Doughty, passed away in July 2024 — a recent loss that the family felt deeply.

Sharon is an active presence in the South Jersey community — engaged in local groups, animal welfare, and the everyday life of the Galloway/Egg Harbor area. She and Rich share their home in Galloway, near Victor and Yvonne, keeping the family close in geography as well as in spirit.

[OWNER INPUT NEEDED: How Sharon came into the family, wedding date and story, her relationship with Victor and Yvonne, her children's names]

## Mary Ann Hurley (nee Elia) — Yvonne's Sister

**Maiden name:** Elia
**Residence:** Stafford Township, NJ (as of 2007); earlier Bayonne, NJ
**Spouse:** Michael Hurley (former Bayonne police officer)

Mary Ann is Yvonne's sister — another daughter of the Elia family of Bayonne. The bond between the Elia sisters has been a constant in the extended family's life.

Mary Ann has her own entrepreneurial story: she ran a pizza bistro in Bayonne, keeping the Italian-American food tradition alive in the neighborhood where she and Yvonne grew up. Whether hosting family celebrations or serving customers in Bayonne, Mary Ann has been a pillar of warmth and hospitality in the extended family.

[OWNER INPUT NEEDED: Mary Ann's pizza bistro name, years of operation, relationship with Victor, family gatherings and traditions, her children if any]

---

## Michael Hurley — Brother-in-law (Yvonne's Side)

**Career:** Former police officer, Bayonne Police Department
**Spouse:** Mary Ann Hurley (nee Elia)

Michael Hurley served as a police officer with the Bayonne Police Department, bringing a law-enforcement perspective to a family already rich with service — Victor's military career, Yvonne's and Victor's education careers, Mary Ann's small business. 

Michael is Victor's brother-in-law through the Elia sisters' marriages, and the Hurley-Cicconetti connection represents the kind of extended family bond that holds Italian-American families together across generations and geographies.

[OWNER INPUT NEEDED: Michael's years of service in Bayonne PD, rank, relationship with Victor, shared interests or activities, family stories]

## Victor's Siblings — The Cicconetti Six

Victor was one of six children born to Victor Cicconetti Sr. (1925-1980) and Eleanor Cicconetti (d. 1997) in Bayonne, NJ:

| Name | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|

| **Dennis Cicconetti** | [OWNER INPUT NEEDED] | Brother. Details sparse. |
| **Rev. Leanora Cicconetti** | Alive | Sister. Reverend at Hope For America Ministries, Bayonne, NJ. Active in NJ genealogy groups. |

| **Loretta Keating** (nee Cicconetti) | Deceased (~2025) | Sister. Married name Keating. |
| **Michael C. Cicconetti** | Deceased (2009) | Brother. Obituary from Jersey City area. |

The Cicconetti siblings grew up together in Bayonne — children of Italian-American New Jersey, shaped by the post-war era. Victor lost his father in 1980 and his mother Eleanor in 1997. More recently, the family said goodbye to Loretta in approximately 2025 and Michael in 2009.

Leanora, a reverend and family genealogy enthusiast, keeps the family history flame burning. Dennis and Bob remain figures the family can help fill in.

[OWNER INPUT NEEDED: Birth order of the siblings, family stories from growing up in Bayonne, relationships between siblings, Dennis and Bob's current status and families, Loretta's family (husband's first name, children)]
