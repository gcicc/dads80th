## Research Gaps & Follow-up Items

- [ ] **William Dunham:** The claim of "6 MAA awards" — I confirmed 5 MAA prizes (Polya, Trevor Evans, Ford, Beckenbach, Chauvenet) plus the AAP Best Mathematics Book award. The sixth MAA award may be the EPADEL section teaching award (confirmed but not a national writing award). The Santa Clara profile says "five prizes from the MAA" which aligns with my count.
- [ ] **Penny Dunham:** Her PhD year from Ohio State is not confirmed in any public source. Her dissertation topic (gender/confidence/calculator/precalculus) is confirmed but the exact title and year are not available.
- [ ] **Lorraine Fitzpatrick:** The "first female full physician" claim at Mayo Clinic appears in IOF tribute context but may need clarification — it could mean first female full professor in a specific division rather than the entire clinic.
- [ ] **Christopher Cannon:** Undergraduate institution not found in any public source. Columbia VP&S class of 1986 is confirmed, but where he did his undergraduate studies is not publicly documented in the sources searched.
- [ ] **Greg's exact co-author role on SOLID-TIMI 52:** Greg is listed in the CLAUDE.md as a co-author, but the JAMA publication author list is very large (TIMI consortium) — Greg's contribution was likely through GSK's biostatistics collaboration with the TIMI group rather than as a named TIMI investigator.
