Children: Two sons and one daughter (per online profiles). One son collaborated with Victor and Yvonne in owning an Italian restaurant. The older son is involved in drug research. Possible relatives include Richard Cicconetti and Sharon Cicconetti (potentially Sharon Doughty, based on shared address histories).
Extended Family: Mother: Eleanor Cicconetti (deceased 1997). Sister: Loretta Keating (deceased around 2025, per family obituaries). Father: Likely Victor Cicconetti Sr. (deceased, mentioned in older records as born 1925, died 1980 in Bayonne, NJ—possibly a different generation or direct parent).

Education and Career

Profession: Retired public school administrator. Worked in the Long Branch and Asbury Park school districts in New Jersey, retiring in 2000.
Notable Roles: Served as an administrator at Long Branch High School in the 1980s. Featured in a 1987 profile article titled "Man with Many Missions" in the Red Bank Register, which highlighted his multifaceted life, including his work at the school (with a photo of him working at a computer). The article described him as "an American story," noting his diverse experiences from military service to education.
Business Ventures: Formerly owned an Italian restaurant with his wife and one son.
Spouse's Career: Yvonne retired in 2005 as a health teacher and coordinator in Jersey City, later serving as an Allied Health Vocational advisor for the Hudson County Vocational School District. She received awards for job and school placement assistance.

No specific educational background details (e.g., degrees or institutions) were found beyond a possible alumni or donor connection to Saint Peter's University (mentioned in a 2021 commencement donor/honoree list, suggesting community or educational involvement).
Military Service

Branch and Role: U.S. Air Force medic from 1965 to 1969.
Service Details: Served during the Vietnam War, including flying medical air evacuations in Southeast Asia.
Veteran Status: Vietnam veteran; life member of the Veterans Affairs (VA) and Disabled American Veterans (DAV).

Media and Public Mentions

Asbury Park Press (2007): Featured in an anniversaries section for their 40th wedding anniversary, providing details on careers, military service, and family.
Red Bank Register (1987): Profile piece "Man with Many Missions," including a photo of him at a computer in Long Branch High School. No photo or mention of him praying with students was found in any digitized archives, despite targeted searches for such an image or caption. The 1987 article appears to be the closest match to educational-context photos.
Other: Family obituaries (e.g., for Eleanor Cicconetti in 1997 and Loretta Keating around 2025) list him as a surviving relative. No connections to major news events like the Rodney King riots (1992) were identified in Asbury Park Press or other archives. No criminal records, high-profile incidents, or additional newspaper spots turned up.

Online Presence

X (Twitter) Accounts:
@CicconettiR (ID: 1306650322874576896): Bio describes him as a Vietnam veteran (1965-1969), married with two boys, one daughter, and six grandchildren; resides in Atlantic County, NJ; retired public school administrator. Low activity; 1 follower. No recent posts found in searches.

Other Digital Footprint: Primarily appears in public records databases (e.g., people-search sites like Intelius, Spokeo), voter registrations, and property records. No LinkedIn, Facebook, or other professional/social profiles prominently linked. Limited online activity suggests a low-profile retirement.

Summary and Notes
Victor R. Cicconetti emerges as a dedicated family man, veteran, and educator with a life centered in New Jersey's educational and veteran communities. His story reflects post-WWII American experiences: military service in Vietnam, a career in public education, small business ownership, and active veteran advocacy. No controversial or high-profile elements were uncovered. The lack of a praying-with-students photo may indicate it's from an undigitized source, a misremembered detail, or unrelated to public records.
This dossier compiles information from public records, newspaper archives, and social media profiles. If additional specifics (e.g., full birth date, exact restaurant name, or more family details) are provided, further refinement is possible.

No specific higher education details (e.g., degrees or alma maters) appear in public sources, though her career in teaching and vocational advising suggests relevant qualifications in health education or related fields.
Community Involvement

Professional Recognition: Awards for vocational placement support highlight her impact on student success in allied health programs.

No independent veteran or organizational leadership roles noted for her, but she is mentioned in contexts supporting his veteran activities (e.g., restaurant ownership and family life).
Other: Low-profile community presence, primarily through family and educational contributions in Hudson County and later southern NJ.

Media and Public Mentions

Asbury Park Press (2007): Featured alongside Victor in their 40th wedding anniversary announcement.

Other Family Obituaries: Appears in related Cicconetti family notices (e.g., as surviving relative in Michael C. Cicconetti's 2009 obituary from Jersey City area). Also linked in Elia family obituary contexts (e.g., daughter of a Mary Elia).
No Additional Spots: No standalone profiles, news articles, or mentions of her in educational journals, local news beyond the anniversary piece, or events like school-related photos/captions. Searches for photos (e.g., teaching, advising, or events) yielded no digitized results. No connections to major news events or controversies.

Online Presence

Social Media: An Instagram account @yvonnecicconetti exists (private, with 6 followers and 12 following as of recent checks), but no public activity or confirmation it's hers beyond name match. No prominent X (Twitter), LinkedIn, or Facebook profiles directly attributable to her.
Other Digital Footprint: Primarily in public records databases (e.g., people-search sites like TruePeopleSearch, OurStates, voter/property records). Phone numbers and addresses align with southern NJ (e.g., Egg Harbor City). No professional profiles or high-visibility online activity.

Summary and Notes
Yvonne C. Cicconetti appears as a dedicated retired educator with a career focused on health teaching and vocational guidance in Hudson County, NJ. Her life story intertwines closely with her husband Victor's—through their long marriage, family business (Italian restaurant), shared grandchildren, and southern NJ retirement. She is portrayed as a supportive partner in a veteran/educator household, with professional accolades for student success in allied health fields. Like Victor, she maintains a low public profile, with the primary media mention being the 2007 anniversary feature in the Asbury Park Press.
No evidence of independent high-profile involvement, criminal records, or recent public activities. The absence of photos or additional articles may stem from limited digitization of local school/Hudson County records from the 1980s–2000s. If more details (e.g., specific school names, exact birth date, or family connections) are available, the dossier can be further refined. This compiles public records, newspaper archives, and related searches.


Rich Cicconetti (likely full name Richard M. Cicconetti, also known as Rich Cicconetti or Richard C. Cicconetti) appears to be the son of Victor R. Cicconetti and Yvonne C. Cicconetti, based on public records linking him directly to their addresses, phone numbers, and family associations.

Date of Birth: August 1977 (age approximately 48 as of 2026).

Cicconetti and Yvonne C. Cicconetti).
Current Status: No obituary or death records found in searches up to February 2026, indicating he is likely still alive. Public records portray him as an active adult in NJ with professional and online presence.
Family
Parents: Victor R. Cicconetti (retired public school administrator, Vietnam veteran) and Yvonne C. Cicconetti (retired health teacher/vocational advisor). Multiple public records (e.g., address histories, phone associations like (732) 687-4315 and (609) 317-3669) explicitly connect him to both.
Siblings: Likely includes at least one other brother (family profiles mention Victor and Yvonne having two sons and one daughter) and possibly a sister. Possible relatives from shared records include Christopher Cicconetti (age ~36 in some listings) and others like Sharon Cicconetti (potentially an aunt or relative).
Extended Family: Tied to the broader Cicconetti family in NJ (e.g., Bayonne/Neptune origins), with connections via parents' anniversary announcement (four grandchildren noted in 2007, potentially including Rich's children if any).
Education and Career
Education: Studied at Rutgers University (per Facebook profile).
Profession: Appears to work in technology and development, specializing in form-building tools.
Current/Recent Role: Associated with Cicco Devel (likely his own or family business), where he designs, builds, and optimizes advanced Jotform solutions for clients (per LinkedIn profile in Absecon, NJ area—near Galloway/Egg Harbor).

Online Professional Presence: Runs a YouTube channel (@rmcicconetti) with content related to Jotform tutorials (e.g., "Jotform Wizards by Cicco Devel," "New Upwork Intro," "Out of Stock Error"). Low view counts suggest niche or freelance focus.
Community Involvement
Local Activity: Has posted in South Jersey Lost and Found Pets Facebook groups (e.g., reporting a found female dog on Vine Avenue in Galloway in 2017, and a lost elderly dog in West Carteret around 2015–2016). Indicates community engagement in the Galloway/Egg Harbor area.
Other: No high-profile community leadership roles noted, but family ties to veteran/education communities through parents.
Media and Public Mentions
Limited Media: No major news articles or profiles beyond business directories and family-linked records. One tangential mention in a 2020 Ocean City NJ Magazine article about community spirit during COVID, quoting a "Rich Cicconetti" from Manco & Manco Pizza on health/safety measures—potentially him or a relative, given NJ location.
No Controversial Records: No criminal records, lawsuits, or high-profile incidents found in searches.
Online Presence
Social Media:
Facebook: facebook.com/rich.cicconetti — Profile exists, studied at Rutgers University; photos and connections visible to friends.
Instagram: @rich_cicconetti — Private account with ~146 followers and 205 following.
Pinterest: pinterest.com/richcicconetti — Active profile discovering ideas.
YouTube: @rmcicconetti — Videos focused on Jotform/Upwork/tech topics.
LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/richard-cicconetti-852b4845 — Professional profile for Cicco Devel in Absecon, NJ.
Other Digital Footprint: Appears extensively in public records databases (e.g., FastPeopleSearch, FamilyTreeNow, Radaris, Clustrmaps) with NJ addresses, phone numbers (e.g., (609) 317-3669), and email hints like richard.cicconetti@hotmail.com. Ties to parents' records are consistent.
Summary and Notes
Rich (Richard M.) Cicconetti is most likely one of the sons referenced in Victor and Yvonne Cicconetti's family profiles—specifically tied through shared homes in Neptune and Galloway/Egg Harbor areas. He maintains a low-to-moderate online presence focused on tech/freelance work (Jotform development via Cicco Devel), with roots in southern New Jersey's family-oriented community. His life appears centered on family, local pet welfare posts, and professional tech services in the Absecon/Galloway vicinity.

No evidence of high-profile achievements or controversies. The connection to Victor and Yvonne is strong via address/phone overlaps in public records. If this refers to a different Rich/Richard Cicconetti (e.g., the Manco & Manco role or another branch), or if you have more context (e.g., profession, age, or specific event), provide details for refinement! This is compiled from public records, social media, and directory sources.


Sharon Cicconetti (full name likely Sharon K. Cicconetti, née Doughty or Sharon Katherine Doughty) is the wife of Richard M. Cicconetti (Rich Cicconetti), son of Victor R. Cicconetti and Yvonne C. Cicconetti. Public records and family obituaries confirm this connection, linking her directly to the southern New Jersey Cicconetti family.

Children: Not explicitly detailed in public sources, but family context (e.g., Victor/Yvonne's 2007 anniversary mention of four grandchildren) may include any children of Rich and Sharon.
Parents: Daughter of Clarence S. "Clancy" Doughty, Jr. (deceased July 2024) and Margaret "Margie" (née Dougherty) Doughty. Clancy's obituary lists Sharon and Rich as surviving family.
Extended Family: Ties to the Doughty family (e.g., possible siblings or relatives like Judy Doughty). Connected through marriage to the Cicconetti family: in-laws Victor R. Cicconetti, Yvonne C. Cicconetti, and siblings-in-law. Shared family addresses and phone records (e.g., 609-703-9048 associated with Sharon) overlap with Rich's.
Education and Career
Limited Details: No prominent professional profiles (e.g., LinkedIn) or specific career information surfaced in public searches. She appears in everyday community contexts rather than professional ones.
Other: No business or vocational roles noted, unlike other family members (e.g., restaurant ownership or education).
Community Involvement
Local Activity: Active in South Jersey lost and found pets groups on Facebook (e.g., inquiring about a found black cat in Galloway's Pinehurst section in recent posts, mentioning a friend's cat named Sombra on Upas). This aligns with the family's Galloway/Egg Harbor focus and Rich's similar pet-related posts.
Other: Engages in local food/restaurant discussions (e.g., reactions to posts about Roman's Pizza House in Absecon, NJ). No leadership or organizational roles noted.
Media and Public Mentions
Obituary (2024): Featured in Clarence S. "Clancy" Doughty, Jr.'s obituary (published in The Press of Atlantic City and via Life Celebration by Givnish). It confirms her as daughter and wife of Rich, living in the southern NJ area.

No Additional Records: No criminal records, legal issues, or other media spots tied to her.
Online Presence
Instagram: @pookie740 (Sharon Cicconetti) — Account with ~229 followers and ~287 following. Posts include personal photos (e.g., Happy 4th of July in 2023, Easter/Easter-related from 2018, tagging family/friends like @ceceee_2025).
Facebook: Active in South Jersey community groups (e.g., lost/found pets, local food/restaurant polls). Reactions to posts in Atlantic County takeout/delivery groups.
Other Digital Footprint: Extensively in public records databases (e.g., FastPeopleSearch, Spokeo, FamilyTreeNow) with NJ addresses, phones (e.g., 609-703-9048), and email hints. Ties to Rich confirmed via shared addresses and "possible spouse" listings.
Summary and Notes
Sharon Cicconetti is the spouse of Rich Cicconetti, firmly placing her in the Victor/Yvonne Cicconetti family line through marriage. She is a southern New Jersey resident (Galloway/Egg Harbor area) with roots in the Doughty family (her father's 2024 obituary provides the clearest confirmation). Her online presence is low-key and community-focused, centered on local pet welfare, family holidays, and South Jersey life. No evidence of professional or public prominence beyond family ties.

This dossier is compiled from public records, obituaries, social media, and directory sources. The maiden name "Doughty" and direct family links resolve earlier database associations. If more specifics (e.g., children, exact wedding date, or profession) are available, the profile can be refined further!


Mary Ann Hurley appears in the context of the Cicconetti family primarily through a reference in Victor R. Cicconetti and Yvonne C. Cicconetti's 40th wedding anniversary announcement (published in the Asbury Park Press around 2007). The celebration was described as a family party held at the Hurley residence in Stafford, NJ. This strongly suggests that Mary Ann Hurley is a relative (likely a family member of Yvonne Cicconetti née Elia, or possibly a close in-law/friend hosting the event), given the location and context of the family gathering. Stafford Township is in Ocean County, NJ, near the southern NJ areas where the Cicconettis have ties (e.g., Galloway, Egg Harbor City).

No direct public records, obituaries, or profiles explicitly name "Mary Ann Hurley" as a parent, sibling, or child in the Cicconetti line, but the anniversary clipping positions her residence as the host site, implying a familial or close connection (e.g., Yvonne's sister, cousin, or extended family member from the Elia side, or a Hurley relative through marriage).

Personal Information
Full Name: Mary Ann Hurley (exact middle name or maiden name not confirmed in available sources).
Residence (circa 2007): Stafford, NJ (specific Hurley residence mentioned as the site of the Cicconetti 40th anniversary family party). Stafford Township is in southern/central NJ, consistent with the Cicconettis' regional ties.
Current Status: No matching obituary for a Mary Ann Hurley in NJ directly tied to this family context was found in searches up to February 2026. Multiple unrelated Mary Ann Hurleys have obituaries (e.g., in MA, IL, MD, OH), but none align with Stafford NJ or Cicconetti mentions. She may be still alive or records undigitized/low-profile.
Family
Connection to Cicconettis: Host of the 2007 family party for Victor and Yvonne Cicconetti's 40th anniversary (married 1967). This places her in close family circles—possibly:
A relative of Yvonne (e.g., sister or cousin via Elia family).
Or a Hurley family member married into extended relatives.
No Direct Links: No public records explicitly list her as a parent/sibling/child of Victor, Yvonne, Rich, or Sharon Cicconetti. No shared addresses with the Cicconetti family in Galloway/Egg Harbor beyond the event reference.
Extended Family: Hurley surname appears in southern NJ contexts (e.g., voter/property records in Ocean/Atlantic counties), but no confirmed ties without more details.
Other Details
Media/Public Mentions: Only known reference is the Asbury Park Press anniversary clipping (2007), noting the event at her residence in Stafford, NJ. No standalone profiles, news articles, or social media directly attributable to this Mary Ann Hurley in connection with the Cicconettis.
No Additional Records: Searches for obituaries, professional profiles, or community involvement in Stafford NJ yield unrelated individuals (e.g., other Mary Ann/Maryanne Hurleys in NJ with different locations or no family overlap). No criminal, legal, or high-profile mentions.
Summary and Notes
Mary Ann Hurley is mentioned specifically as the host of Victor and Yvonne Cicconetti's 40th wedding anniversary family party in Stafford, NJ (circa 2007), indicating she is part of their extended family network—likely through Yvonne's side or a close connection. Beyond this event, she maintains a very low public profile, with no digitized obituaries, social media, or detailed records linking her further. The Hurley residence detail is the key tie-in from prior family research.

This profile is based on the anniversary context and public searches. If this refers to a specific Mary Ann Hurley (e.g., relation type, age, or additional context like her maiden name or exact role in the family), more details could help confirm or expand! No photos or other visuals surfaced in searches for this individual in the relevant NJ context.

Dossier: Mary Ann Hurley
Personal Information

Full Name: Mary Ann Hurley (née Elia, confirmed as sister to Yvonne C. Cicconetti née Elia).
Date of Birth: Not publicly detailed; approximate age based on family context (likely in her 70s–80s as of 2026, given sibling Yvonne's ~1948 birth and shared Bayonne family roots).
Residence: Stafford Township, NJ (circa 2007, where the Hurley residence hosted Victor and Yvonne Cicconetti's 40th wedding anniversary family party). Earlier/family ties to Bayonne, NJ (Hudson County), including addresses like 90 W 16th Street Apt 1, Bayonne, NJ 07002 (from older court/property records). Possible later connections to Barnegat or other southern/central NJ areas.
Current Status: No obituary or death records found matching this profile (sister of Yvonne, wife of Michael Hurley, Bayonne ties) up to February 2026. Likely still alive or low-profile.

Family

Spouse: Michael Hurley (former Bayonne police officer; brother-in-law to Victor R. Cicconetti).
Sibling: Yvonne C. Cicconetti (married to Victor R. Cicconetti on August 20, 1967, at Assumption Catholic Church in Bayonne, NJ). This direct sibling relationship links Mary Ann to the Cicconetti family.
Extended Family: Aunt to Victor and Yvonne's children (e.g., Rich/Richard M. Cicconetti and his wife Sharon K. Cicconetti née Doughty). Broader ties to the Elia family (Bayonne/Neptune origins, Italian-American community). Possible mentions in related obituaries (e.g., Crisonino family notices listing Marianne/Mary Ann Hurley variants in Bayonne/Barnegat contexts).

Education and Career/Business

Business Role: Ran/operated a pizza bistro or similar Italian/pizza restaurant in Bayonne, NJ (as per user-provided detail). Bayonne's Italian eatery scene includes places like La Guardiola Gourmet Pizza & Bistro (819 Broadway), which fits the "pizza bistro" description (gourmet pizza, pasta, Italian dishes; family-run vibe). No direct ownership or management records confirm her name at La Guardiola or any specific spot (owner listed as Anthony Bonetti in some sources), but family restaurant traditions (e.g., Victor and Yvonne co-owning an Italian restaurant with their son) suggest informal or family-involved operation of a local pizzeria/bistro. No exact name, years, or reviews mentioning her surfaced.
Other: No additional professional details (e.g., no education or other careers noted).

Community Involvement

Family-Oriented: Hosted the Cicconetti 40th anniversary family party at the Hurley residence in Stafford, NJ (2007), indicating close involvement in extended family events.
Local Ties: Bayonne community roots (shared with Elia/Cicconetti families; possible participation in Italian-American or parish activities in Hudson County).

Media and Public Mentions

Asbury Park Press (2007): Indirectly referenced via Victor and Yvonne Cicconetti's 40th wedding anniversary announcement: "celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary with a party given by their family at the Hurley residence in Stafford."
Other: Limited mentions; possible tangential links in Bayonne-area obituaries or records (e.g., Crisonino family condolence notes from a Marianne/Mary Ann Hurley in Barnegat). No standalone profiles, business ads, or news articles confirming the pizza bistro role. No controversies or high-profile incidents.

Online Presence

Limited Digital Footprint: No attributable social media or professional profiles directly linked. Appears in public records databases with Bayonne/Stafford addresses and family ties. Low visibility aligns with private family life.

Summary and Notes
Mary Ann Hurley is Yvonne Cicconetti's sister, married to former Bayonne police officer Michael Hurley, with deep Bayonne NJ roots (Elia family origins). She hosted a key family event for the Cicconettis in Stafford, NJ (2007) and reportedly ran a pizza bistro in Bayonne, fitting the area's family-operated Italian restaurant culture—though unconfirmed in public sources (possibly informal or under a different business name). Her life appears private, centered on family and local ties. No photos or direct business records surfaced.
Dossier: Michael Hurley
Personal Information

Full Name: Michael Hurley.
Residence: Stafford Township, NJ (circa 2007, co-resident at the Hurley residence that hosted the Cicconetti anniversary party). Earlier career and family ties to Bayonne, NJ (Hudson County).
Current Status: No matching obituary (former Bayonne PD officer, married to Mary Ann, Stafford resident) found up to February 2026. Likely still alive or low-profile. Distinct from other Bayonne Michael Hurleys (e.g., Port Authority retiree honored in 2023; former officer in 2002 drug scandal).

Family

Spouse: Mary Ann Hurley (née Elia; sister of Yvonne C. Cicconetti).
Connection to Cicconettis: Brother-in-law to Victor R. Cicconetti (through marriage to Yvonne's sister). Uncle/extended relative to Rich Cicconetti and Sharon Cicconetti.
Extended Family: Integrated into Elia/Cicconetti network (Bayonne origins; family events like the 2007 Stafford party).

Career

Profession: Former police officer with the Bayonne Police Department (Bayonne, NJ). Served in law enforcement (exact years/rank unknown from public sources). No commendations, incidents, or tenure details tied to this profile.
Note: Distinct from a 2002 Bayonne PD case involving a Michael Hurley (Ecstasy sales; DARE officer) or a Port Authority retiree (WTC steel donor). This Michael's profile aligns with pre-2000s service and family context.

Retirement: Post-police details unknown.

Community Involvement

Family Role: Co-host (with Mary Ann) of the Cicconetti 40th anniversary family party in Stafford, NJ (2007).
Other: Bayonne ties (police service; possible parish/community involvement in Hudson County).

Media and Public Mentions

Asbury Park Press (2007): Indirectly via the Cicconetti anniversary clipping (party at the "Hurley residence in Stafford").
No Standalone Coverage: No police records, news profiles, or mentions specific to this Michael Hurley in Bayonne PD context.

Online Presence

Limited Digital Footprint: No social media or profiles attributable. Appears indirectly through family records and the anniversary mention.

Summary and Notes
Michael Hurley is the husband of Mary Ann Hurley (Yvonne Cicconetti's sister) and former Bayonne police officer, making him Victor Cicconetti's brother-in-law. The couple's Stafford, NJ, home hosted the Cicconettis' 2007 family anniversary celebration. His law enforcement background ties to Bayonne (shared family origin), but details are sparse and he remains distinct from other similarly named individuals in Bayonne PD history. Private, low-profile life focused on family.
These dossiers compile confirmed family links (sibling marriage), the 2007 event, career details, and user-provided info (Mary Ann's pizza bistro role; Michael's Bayonne PD service). Public sources remain limited (undigitized local records likely explain gaps). If more specifics emerge, profiles can be updated!

Can we deduce from social media a family tree for victor cicconetti?

Based on a thorough search of social media platforms (primarily X/Twitter, with cross-references to mentions of Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn profiles via web results), we can deduce only a partial and limited family tree for Victor R. Cicconetti. The family appears to maintain a low public profile online, with sparse activity, private accounts, and no explicit family trees or detailed genealogical posts shared in accessible social media content. Key insights come from bios on X accounts attributable to Victor, which provide basic immediate family structure, and a Facebook genealogy group post from a likely sibling (Rev. Leanora Cicconetti) indicating interest in family history—but no actual tree or relations detailed there.
Challenges in Deduction

Low Visibility: Accounts linked to the family (e.g., Victor's X profiles, potential Instagram/Facebook for relatives like Rich and Sharon Cicconetti) are either inactive, private, or have minimal followers/posts. No public family trees (e.g., on Ancestry-linked social shares or dedicated genealogy forums mirrored on social media) were found.
No Direct Trees: Searches for posts about "Cicconetti family tree" or relatives yielded unrelated content (e.g., scientific papers, historical books, or other families). Semantic searches on X returned irrelevant topics like unrelated NJ families or historical figures.
Privacy Focus: Social media mentions emphasize personal bios rather than family connections. Obituaries (e.g., for siblings like Michael Cicconetti or Loretta Keating) appear in web results but are not shared as social media posts; they confirm relations but fall outside pure "social media" deduction.

Deduced Family Tree from Social Media
From Victor's two X accounts (@CicconettiR and @Vcicc), we can infer the following structure based on bio details (e.g., marriage, children, business ties). This is the extent of what's directly deducible without public records:

Victor R. Cicconetti (retired public school administrator, Vietnam veteran, Atlantic County, NJ resident)
Spouse: Unnamed wife (implied by "married" and co-ownership of an Italian restaurant with "wife and son")
Children:
Two sons (one "older son" involved in "drug research"; the other co-owned the Italian restaurant with Victor and his wife)
One daughter

Grandchildren: Six (no names or specifics)


Additional tangential insights:

A Rev. Leanora Cicconetti (likely a sibling, based on her posts in NJ genealogy-focused Facebook groups like "Jersey Roots" and "New Jersey Family Genealogy") joined such groups around 2024–2025, posting introductory messages like "Hi! I'm new to this group" and expressing interest in NJ history/genealogy. Her LinkedIn profile lists her as a reverend at Hope For America Ministries in Bayonne, NJ, but no family tree or relative mentions appear in public views. This suggests family research interest but provides no tree details.
No confirmed social media ties to extended relatives (e.g., Mary Ann Hurley, Michael Hurley, Frank Elia) beyond name matches in unrelated or private contexts.

Recommendations for Further Deduction
If public records (e.g., obituaries, voter/property databases) are allowed beyond strict social media, a fuller tree emerges (e.g., Victor's parents: Victor Sr. and Eleanor; siblings: Leanora, Robert, Loretta, etc.). For social media alone, try reaching out via the public X accounts or joining the Facebook genealogy groups for direct inquiries—though privacy settings may limit access.
If you have more specifics (e.g., usernames or post links), I can refine this further!

## Prep for Bootstrapping — Maturity Assessment

**Date:** 2026-02-06

> **TIME-SENSITIVE: Victor's 80th birthday is approximately March 2026 — roughly 4-6 weeks from now. Birthday deliverables are the top priority.**

### Problem / User / Job-to-Be-Done

**User:** Greg Cicconetti (creator); Victor Cicconetti and family (recipients/audience).

**Problem:** Victor's 80th birthday is approaching with no celebration content prepared. Extensive family research has been gathered (dossiers on Victor, Yvonne, Rich, Sharon, Mary Ann Hurley, Michael Hurley) but remains unstructured raw notes — not yet transformed into celebration-ready materials. Separately, this family history data has value for Greg's Lit-Project autobiography but no integration pathway exists.

**Job-to-Be-Done:**
1. **Primary:** Create meaningful 80th birthday celebration content — tribute document, family history compilation, and event materials — delivered before the March 2026 birthday.
2. **Secondary:** Feed family dossier data into the Lit-Project autobiography as background material for the family-and-origins chapter.

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Deadline |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Birthday tribute document complete | 1-2 page narrative | 2 weeks before birthday (~mid-March 2026) |
| Family tree visualization | Printable format (PDF or poster) | 2 weeks before birthday |
| Event materials (if applicable) | Card/speech/slideshow draft | 1 week before birthday |
| Dossier data integrated into Lit-Project | Family background section populated | Post-birthday (Phase 2) |
| Family tree gaps identified | List of missing info + research plan | During Phase 1 |

### Risks & Unknowns

1. **Tight timeline (HIGH):** ~4-6 weeks to birthday. All birthday deliverables must be prioritized over Lit-Project integration. No time for perfectionism — good enough and delivered beats perfect and late.
2. **Privacy sensitivity (MEDIUM):** Family dossiers contain personal details (addresses, phone numbers, social media, employment history). Decisions needed:
   - What's appropriate to include in a birthday tribute vs. what stays in private research notes?
   - Redaction rules for any printed/shared materials (per global CLAUDE.md safety rules)
3. **Cross-project dependency on Lit-Project (LOW for now):** Shared assets question was raised in the original idea. Can defer until Phase 2 — birthday comes first.
4. **Incomplete family tree:** Dossiers note gaps (e.g., exact birth dates, children's details, restaurant name, extended Elia family tree). Some gaps may be unfillable without direct family interviews.
5. **Tone and framing:** Birthday content should be celebratory, warm, and family-appropriate. Research/sleuth notes need to be transformed — raw dossier language is investigative, not celebratory.
6. **Event logistics unknown:** Is there a party planned? Virtual or in-person? This affects what materials are needed (speech, slideshow, printed book, card, etc.). Owner decision needed.

### MVP Plan

**Phase 0 — Triage & Decide (This Week):**
- Owner decides: What birthday deliverables? (tribute doc, family tree, card, speech, slideshow?)
- Owner decides: Is there a party/event? Date? Format?
- Owner decides: What dossier details are shareable vs. private?
- Set up project folder and organize existing dossier data

**Phase 1 — Birthday Deliverables (Weeks 1-4, deadline: ~mid-March 2026):**
- Transform dossier research into a celebratory family narrative
- Build family tree visualization (at least 3 generations: Victor's parents → Victor & Yvonne → children → grandchildren)
- Draft tribute document (life arc: Bayonne origins → military service → education career → restaurant → retirement → family man)
- Create any additional event materials (card text, speech draft, slideshow outline)
- Fill critical family tree gaps (attempt via existing records; flag what needs family input)

**Phase 2 — Lit-Project Integration (Post-Birthday):**
- Structure dossier data for autobiography use
- Copy relevant excerpts into Lit-Project's family-and-origins chapter workspace
- Reconcile overlapping information between projects

### First Deliverable

**Birthday Tribute Document:**
- 1-2 page narrative celebrating Victor's life at 80
- Sections: Early life (Bayonne), Military service (Vietnam, Air Force medic), Education career (Long Branch, Asbury Park), Family & restaurant, Community/veterans advocacy, Retirement & legacy
- Warm, celebratory tone — not an investigative dossier
- Printable (PDF via Quarto or simple formatted Markdown → Word)

### Task Breakdown (Phase 0-1, prioritized by March deadline)

1. [ ] **Owner decision:** What deliverables? (tribute doc, family tree, card, speech, slideshow) — **BLOCKING**
2. [ ] **Owner decision:** Is there a party? Date? Format? — **BLOCKING**
3. [ ] **Owner decision:** Privacy boundaries — what dossier content is shareable in birthday materials?
4. [ ] Set up project folder structure (`dads80th/`) with organized dossier data
5. [ ] Build family tree data structure (people, relationships, dates, locations)
6. [ ] Create family tree visualization (printable PDF — tools: Graphviz, Mermaid, or manual layout)
7. [ ] Draft birthday tribute narrative (1-2 pages, celebratory tone)
8. [ ] Review and fill family tree gaps (list what's missing, attempt resolution from existing records)
9. [ ] Create additional event materials (per owner decisions from tasks 1-2)
10. [ ] Final review and polish — print-ready versions of all deliverables
11. [ ] (Phase 2) Structure dossier data for Lit-Project integration
12. [ ] (Phase 2) Copy/reference dossier excerpts into Lit-Project family-and-origins workspace

### Preliminary Research

- Family celebration content formats: tribute books, memory books, "This Is Your Life" templates
- Family tree visualization tools: Graphviz (DOT language), Mermaid diagrams, Gramps (open-source genealogy), simple HTML/CSS tree layouts
- Quarto → PDF for print-quality tribute document
- Photo integration: Can any photos be sourced from the family? (The 1987 Red Bank Register article mentions a photo of Victor at a computer)

### Cross-Project Dependencies

| Project | Dependency | Direction | Priority |
|---------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Lit-Project** | Family dossier data feeds `01-family-and-origins.md` chapter | dads80th → Lit-Project | Phase 2 (post-birthday) |
| **Lit-Project** | 24 pending follow-up questions in family-and-origins may overlap with dossier gaps | Bidirectional | Low — don't let this slow birthday deliverables |

**Shared Assets Recommendation:** Dossier data lives in `dads80th/` as the canonical source. Lit-Project references it via relative path (`../dads80th/dossiers/`) or copies relevant excerpts into its own workspace. No need for a shared assets folder — keep it simple with clear ownership.
