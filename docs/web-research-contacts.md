**Location:** Bayonne, NJ
**Title:** Reverend
**Ministry:** Hope For America Ministries (Bayonne, NJ area)

### What We Found
- Confirmed as a reverend and minister based in Bayonne, NJ.
- Also known by the name Leanora Clavelli (possible married or alternate name).
- Referenced in an obituary guestbook entry as "Pastor Leanora Cicconetti" — confirming active pastoral role.
- Per the extended-family doc: active in NJ genealogy groups, keeps the family history flame burning.

## 3. Mike Hurley — Greg's First Cousin (Mary Ann Hurley's Son)

**Location:** Likely NJ area (Bayonne/Stafford Township family roots)
**Family:** Son of Mary Ann Hurley (nee Elia) and Michael Hurley (former Bayonne PD)

### What We Found
- Multiple "Mike Hurley" professionals in construction appear in search results, but none could be definitively matched to the correct person:
  - Mike Hurley, Vice President at Clark Construction Group
  - Mike Hurley, VP/GM at Alston Construction
  - Mike Hurley, Owner of MJ Hurley Industrial Services LLC
- Hurley Development (Vancouver, WA) is a different company/family — not connected.
- No trail running or ultramarathon race results found under this name in UltraSignup, DUV, or iRunFar databases (searched broadly).

### Confidence: LOW
Too many "Mike Hurley" matches in construction without a distinguishing detail (location, company name) to confirm the right one. Trail running results also did not surface.

### Action Items
- [ ] Ask Greg: What is the name of Mike's construction/development company?
- [ ] Ask Greg: What races has Mike run? (Specific race names would help find results.)
- [ ] Ask Greg: Where does Mike live now? (NJ, PA, elsewhere?)

## 6. Riley Wexler — Married to Greg's Daughter Ellie

**Education (Undergraduate):** Muhlenberg College, Class of 2024 — Chemistry major, Mathematics minor
**Research:** NSF REU at University of Michigan (Summer 2023) — Theoretical/computational chemistry
**Graduate School Plans:** PhD in Chemistry (confirmed intent as of 2023)

### What We Found

**Muhlenberg College (Undergraduate):**
- Riley Wexler '24 was featured in a [Muhlenberg College news article (2023)](https://www.muhlenberg.edu/news/2023/chemistryreu.html) about two chemistry students accepted to the University of Michigan's NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program.
- Chemistry major, mathematics minor.
- Chose to work in a theoretical/computational chemistry lab during the Michigan REU.
- "Enjoyed the two labs he worked in at Muhlenberg as well as his Michigan lab."
- Expressed intent to pursue a PhD in chemistry, though "not yet sure what he'll pursue in grad school" as of the 2023 article.

**UCLA Connection:**
- The research prompt states Riley is a Chemistry PhD student at UCLA. This was not independently confirmed via the UCLA Chemistry department's current graduate student listing or any public source. The UCLA graduate student directory did not return a match.
- This may be because: (a) the directory is not fully up to date, (b) he may be listed under a slightly different name, or (c) he may be in a different department/program.

### Confidence: MEDIUM
Muhlenberg undergraduate career is well-documented. UCLA PhD enrollment is stated but not independently verified from public sources.

### Action Items
- [ ] Check UCLA Chemistry department's [current graduate students page](https://www.chemistry.ucla.edu/current-graduate-students) directly.
- [ ] Ask Greg/Ellie to confirm Riley's lab advisor at UCLA for a more targeted search.
- [ ] Any publications would likely appear on Google Scholar once research is underway.

## 7. Chris Hollswander — Extended Family, Smithsonian

**Employer:** Smithsonian Institution (per family information)

### What We Found

- The Holschwander surname has roots in the Lehigh Valley / eastern Pennsylvania area (multiple obituaries in The Morning Call for Russell Holschwander of Fountain Hill, PA; Donald J. Holschwander; Virginia C. Holschwander).
- The surname is uncommon — the Names Encyclopedia (namespedia.com) lists it as very rare.
- Smithsonian staff directories are extensive but not all employees appear in public-facing search results, especially in non-research or non-curatorial roles.

No public confirmation of this person's role at the Smithsonian was found. The name spelling may differ, or the person may work in a role that does not appear in public directories.
