## The Bayonne Kid

Victor grew up in Bayonne, New Jersey, the son of Victor Cicconetti Sr. (1925-1980) and Eleanor (Salone) Cicconetti (d. 1997) — part of a big, close-knit Italian-American family. The Cicconetti name traces back to **Collepietro**, a tiny stone village perched nearly 3,000 feet up in Italy's Apennine Mountains in the Abruzzo region. Victor's mother Eleanor brought the Salone family's Lower East Side Manhattan toughness — her mother Anna had worked as a sweatshop seamstress during the Depression to keep her three daughters out of an orphanage.

Victor was one of six children: Dennis, Leanora, Bob, Loretta, and Michael all called Bayonne home alongside Vic. The neighborhood, the church, the family table — these were the foundations that shaped everything that came after. Bayonne in the 1940s and 50s was a city where 20% of the population was Italian-American, where paesani from the same villages in Abruzzo and beyond lived side by side, and where the immigrant generation's sacrifices were repaid by the next generation's opportunities.

## Answering the Call

In 1965, at just nineteen years old, Victor joined the United States Air Force as a medic. For four years — through some of the most challenging times in American history — he served his country during the Vietnam War, flying medical air evacuations across Southeast Asia. He did not simply serve; he saved lives, transporting wounded servicemembers out of harm's way and into care. It is the kind of quiet heroism that defines a generation.

His service from 1965 to 1969 shaped him permanently — instilling a deep sense of duty, discipline, and compassion for fellow veterans that has never wavered.

## A Career in Education

After returning from Vietnam, Victor built a career in New Jersey's public school system that spanned decades. He served as an administrator at Long Branch High School during the 1980s, where a 1987 Red Bank Register profile titled "Man with Many Missions" captured him at work — a man of many parts, described as "an American story" for the breadth of his experiences.

He also worked in the Asbury Park school district, dedicating himself to the education of young people across some of New Jersey's most dynamic communities. When he retired in 2000, he left behind a legacy of service to students and schools that had stretched across his entire adult life.

## The Entrepreneur

Victor's energy never stayed in one lane. Together with Yvonne and one of their sons, he co-owned and operated an Italian restaurant — a family venture that brought together the Cicconetti love of food, family, and community. The details of that chapter are a family story waiting to be told more fully.

## Serving Those Who Served

Victor's commitment to his fellow veterans did not end when he took off the uniform. He became a founding member and president of Vietnam Veterans of America Chapter 12 in Ocean Township, NJ — an organization dedicated to ensuring that Vietnam veterans received the recognition, support, and advocacy they deserved. He is a life member of both the VA and the Disabled American Veterans (DAV).

For Vic, the brotherhood of service was never something you walked away from. It was something you carried forward.

## Family Man

At the center of Victor's life is family. He married Yvonne C. Elia on August 20, 1967, at Assumption Catholic Church in Bayonne — a partnership that has endured and flourished for nearly six decades. Together they raised three children — two sons and a daughter — and have been blessed with six grandchildren.

Now, as Victor approaches his 80th birthday in March 2026, the family gathers once again — this time to honor the man who has been father, grandfather, veteran, educator, entrepreneur, and community leader. A man whose life truly is, as the Red Bank Register wrote in 1987, "an American story."
