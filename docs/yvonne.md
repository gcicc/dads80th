## Bayonne Roots — An Immigration Story

Yvonne grew up in Bayonne, New Jersey, as Yvonne C. Elia — daughter of Frank Elia and Mary Elia. The Elia family was part of the wave of Italian immigrants who came through Ellis Island and settled in Bayonne's tight-knit Italian-American community in Hudson County. Mary herself came through Ellis Island with her sister(s), carrying the courage and hope of a new life in America.

The Elia surname traces to southern Italy — most concentrated in Puglia, with strong presence in Calabria, Campania, and Sicily. The family settled near Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church, the heart of Bayonne's Italian community, in the Bergen Point neighborhood. By the early 1920s, the Elia family was established in Bayonne (Salvatore Elia, born December 22, 1921, in New Jersey, is the earliest documented member of the Bayonne Elia family).

Yvonne's childhood was shaped by that Italian-American community and by the early loss of her father, Frank, who died when Yvonne was only about fourteen years old (~1962). That loss, and the strength it required, became part of the fabric of who Yvonne would become: resilient, caring, and fiercely devoted to family. After Frank's death, Mary remarried Anthony Galella — a man who became a beloved stepfather. Greg named his own son Anthony in his honor.

Her sister Mary Ann (later Mary Ann Hurley) shared those Bayonne roots, and the bond between the Elia sisters has remained a constant across the decades.

See `docs/elia-immigration-research.md` for the full Elia family immigration research.

[RESOLVED: Mary's maiden name is **CHIAROLANZA** (family spelling: Chirolanza). The Chiarolanza family originated in Campania, southern Italy -- most likely Montecorvino Rovella, Province of Salerno. Mary's father was Alfonso Chiarolanza, mother Angelina. Mary had 4 sisters. See `docs/chirolanza-research.md` for full research.]

[OWNER INPUT NEEDED: Childhood memories, school, Bayonne neighborhood stories, relationship with her mother Mary, sister Mary Ann, and stepfather Anthony Galella growing up, names of Mary's sisters (the 4 Chiarolanza sisters)]

## A Life in Education

Yvonne built a distinguished career in education that spanned decades. She served as a health teacher and coordinator in the Jersey City public school system, where she dedicated herself to the wellbeing and development of her students. When she retired from Jersey City in 2005, she had earned recognition not just for her teaching but for her genuine investment in young people's futures.

Her impact did not stop at retirement. Yvonne went on to serve as an Allied Health Vocational advisor for the Hudson County Vocational School District, where she helped students find their way into careers in healthcare and allied health fields. Her work there earned her multiple awards for excellence in job and school placement — a testament to how many lives she touched by connecting young people with opportunities.

## The Partnership

Yvonne and Victor were married on August 20, 1967, at Assumption Catholic Church in Bayonne. It was a union that would endure through Vietnam-era separations, career changes, entrepreneurial ventures, raising three children, and the joys of six grandchildren.

Together, they co-owned an Italian restaurant with one of their sons — a family enterprise that brought the Cicconetti warmth and Italian heritage to the table in a very literal way. Whether in the classroom, the kitchen, or the living room, Yvonne has been the kind of partner who makes everything around her stronger.

## Mother and Grandmother

Yvonne and Victor raised two sons and a daughter. She has been grandmother to six — a role that, for anyone who knows her, likely comes as naturally as breathing. The family she and Victor built stretches across southern New Jersey and carries forward the values of education, service, and togetherness that have defined both their lives.

## The Quiet Strength

If Victor is described in newspaper profiles as "a man with many missions," Yvonne is the foundation that made those missions possible. Her own career accomplishments — health educator, vocational advisor, award-winning placement counselor — stand on their own. But the full picture of Yvonne includes her role as the partner who held everything together: raising children while Victor served, building a home, supporting community work, and bringing an educator's patience and care to every aspect of family life.

As Victor turns 80, it is impossible to celebrate his story without celebrating hers alongside it. Nearly sixty years of marriage is not a footnote — it is the story.
