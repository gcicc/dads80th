## Executive Summary

The maiden name "Chirolanza" is a simplified/Americanized spelling of the Italian surname **CHIAROLANZA**. This is a rare surname (only ~1,268 bearers worldwide) that is overwhelmingly concentrated in **Campania, southern Italy** (88% of Italian bearers). The Antenati Italiani genealogy database links the surname specifically to **Montecorvino Rovella, Province of Salerno, Campania**. A WikiTree entry documents a Chiarolanza marriage in **Caserta, Terra di Lavoro** (also Campania) in 1849.

The 1940 U.S. Census confirms a **Mary Chiarolanza, age 20, born ~1920 in Italy**, living in **Bayonne, New Jersey** with her father **Alphonso (Alfonso) Chiarolanza**, mother **Angeline (Angelina)**, and **4 sisters**. This is Greg Cicconetti's maternal grandmother -- the Mary who came through Ellis Island with her sister(s), married Frank Elia, worked as a seamstress at Maidenform, and later married Anthony Galella.

## The Name: Chirolanza vs. Chiarolanza

### Spelling Variants
- **Chiarolanza** -- correct Italian spelling (the form found in all records)
- **Chirolanza** -- Americanized/simplified spelling (as remembered by the family)
- Other possible variants to search: Cirolanza, Kirolanza, Chiarolanca (none found in records)

### Etymology
The surname is a compound Italian name:
- **Chiara/Chiaro** -- "bright, clear, light" (from Latin *clarus*)

Literal meaning: **"Bright Lance"** -- likely a medieval nickname or a descriptive occupational name.

## The Bayonne Chiarolanza Household (1940 Census)

### Confirmed from Ancestry.com 1940 Census Index

**Mary Chiarolanza** -- [Ancestry 1940 Census record](https://www.ancestry.com/1940-census/usa/New-Jersey/Mary-Chiarolanza_4npqny)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | Mary Chiarolanza |
| Age | 20 |
| Birth year | ~1920 |
| Birthplace | Italy |
| Residence (1940) | Bayonne, New Jersey |
| Father | Alphonso (Alfonso) Chiarolanza |
| Mother | Angeline (Angelina) Chiarolanza |

| Total household | 7 (father, mother, Mary, 4 sisters) |

### What This Tells Us

1. **Mary was born ~1920 in Italy** -- She immigrated as a child or young woman, arriving with family at Ellis Island. If Yvonne was born ~1948, Mary was ~28 when Yvonne was born -- plausible.

3. **Mary had 4 sisters** -- The family oral history says "Mary came through Ellis Island with her sister(s)." The census confirms at least 4 sisters. Their names require Ancestry subscription access to view the full census image.

4. **The family was in Bayonne by 1940** -- Alfonso and Angelina Chiarolanza settled their family in Bayonne, joining the Italian immigrant community in Hudson County.

### Estimated Immigration Timeline

| ~1920 | Mary born in Italy (Campania, likely near Montecorvino Rovella or Caserta area) |
| ~1920-1935 | Alfonso and Angelina Chiarolanza emigrate with daughters, arrive at Ellis Island, settle in Bayonne, NJ |
| ~1940 | Census: Alfonso, Angelina, Mary (20), and 4 sisters in Bayonne |

## The Pennsylvania Chiarolanza Branch

Extensive obituary research reveals a well-documented Chiarolanza family in the Philadelphia / Delaware County area of Pennsylvania. This appears to be a **separate branch** from the same Italian origin -- the 1940 Census shows the Chiarolanza family name in both New Jersey (Mary in Bayonne) and Pennsylvania.

### Pennsylvania Chiarolanza Family Members (from obituaries)

## Mary Chiarolanza Obituary (Atlantic City, 2008)

A Mary Chiarolanza obituary appeared in **The Press of Atlantic City on February 16, 2008**. This could potentially be Greg's grandmother Mary:
- Atlantic City is in Atlantic County, NJ -- near Egg Harbor City where Victor and Yvonne live
- The timing (~2008) and location (Atlantic County) are consistent with Mary moving to South Jersey later in life, possibly near her daughter Yvonne

**Status:** The full obituary text requires Legacy.com or GenealogyBank subscription access. This is a HIGH-PRIORITY record to retrieve -- it would list surviving children (Yvonne Cicconetti, Mary Ann Hurley, Frank Elia Jr.) and confirm the connection.

## Maidenform: Where Mary Worked

Mary Chiarolanza Elia worked as a seamstress at the Maidenform factory in Bayonne. Here is the full historical context:

| Detail | Facts |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | Maidenform (founded 1922 by Ida & William Rosenthal and Enid Bissett) |
| **Bayonne factory address** | 154 Avenue E at 18th Street, Bayonne, NJ 07002 |
| **Building** | Five-story brick building, originally Schwarzenbach Huber Mill (c. 1890-1910) |
| **Maidenform occupied** | 1929-2005 (76 years) |
| **Peak employment** | ~1,300 workers (1940) |
| **Products** | Brassieres; during WWII also parachutes and carrier pigeon vests |
| **Workforce** | Largely immigrant women, many Italian-American seamstresses from the Bayonne community |
| **Current status** | Building converted to "Silk Lofts" residential apartments (2014), 85 units |
| **Significance** | Maidenform was Bayonne's largest employer for decades; the factory was a landmark |

Mary would have been part of the generation of Italian immigrant women who worked the production lines at Maidenform, hand-sewing garments in the same factory where pigeon vests for WWII paratroopers were produced. Another Bayonne woman, **Mary Treglia**, worked as a seamstress at Maidenform for 50 years (per her obituary), showing how these factory jobs defined careers for immigrant women in the community.

## Frank Elia: Mary's First Husband

### What We Know
- Married Mary Chiarolanza in Bayonne, NJ (~1940-1945)
- Occupation: "chicken plucker" (family oral history)
- Died ~1962 in Bayonne (when Yvonne was ~14)
- Children with Mary: Yvonne (~1948), Mary Ann "Bubbles", Frank Jr.
- No online obituary found (1962 pre-dates digital records)

### The "Chicken Plucker" Trade
Frank Elia was known as a "chicken plucker" -- a poultry processing worker. Italian immigrants in the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area were heavily involved in the poultry trade. Live poultry markets were common in urban Italian-American neighborhoods through the mid-20th century. Workers like Frank would have processed chickens at a live poultry market or processing facility, plucking feathers after slaughter. This was hard physical labor typical of first- and second-generation Italian immigrant men.

The Elia surname is most concentrated in Puglia (southern Italy), with secondary presence in Calabria, Campania, and Sicily -- consistent with southern Italian immigration patterns to Bayonne.

### Frank Elia -- Disambiguating Records

The Frank J. Elia who died September 11, 2015 (age 73, born Dec 28, 1941) is **NOT** Yvonne's father -- he is too young and his wife's maiden name was Anderson. His siblings were Arlene Seeley (Dave) and Joseph Elia (Pam). This Frank may be a cousin or nephew within the broader Bayonne Elia family.

---

## The Chiarolanza Sisters: What We Need

The 1940 Census shows Mary Chiarolanza (age 20) with **4 sisters** in the Bayonne household. The family oral history says "Mary came through Ellis Island with her sister(s)."

### To identify the sisters, the following records are needed:

1. **1940 Census full image** (Ancestry subscription) -- The actual census page will list all 7 household members with names, ages, birthplaces, immigration year, and occupations.

2. **1930 Census** -- If the family was in Bayonne by 1930, this census would show the sisters as younger children, with parents' immigration details.

3. **Ship manifest** -- Search Ellis Island passenger records for Alfonso/Alphonso Chiarolanza arriving from Italy with family (Angelina and daughters), estimated arrival ~1920-1935.

4. **Mary Chiarolanza obituary (Atlantic City, 2008)** -- Would list surviving siblings.

## Earliest Known Chiarolanza Records (Italy)

### Antenati Italiani (Italian State Archives)
- **Location:** Montecorvino Rovella, Province of Salerno, Campania
- **Records span:** 1844-1889
- **Number of records:** 7 events, 12 ancestors
- **Common first names:** Gaetano (2), Giovanni (2), Luigi (2), Maria (2)

### WikiTree
- **Francesca Esposito** married **Nicola Chiarolanza** on December 6, 1849 in **Caserta, Terra di Lavoro, Italia**
- They had at least one son: **Giovanni Chiarolanza**
- Francesca was born 1823, daughter of Giovanni Esposito and Raffaela Margarita

### What This Suggests
The Chiarolanza family has documented roots in at least two areas of Campania:
1. **Montecorvino Rovella** (Province of Salerno) -- civil records 1844-1889
2. **Caserta** (Province of Caserta) -- marriage record 1849

Both are in the Campania region, consistent with the 88% concentration of the surname there. The Bayonne Chiarolanza family (Alfonso and Angelina) almost certainly came from one of these areas, or a nearby town in Campania.

*This research fills the critical genealogical gap identified in `elia-immigration-research.md`: Mary Elia's maiden name was CHIAROLANZA (Americanized to Chirolanza). The family originated in Campania, southern Italy -- most likely Montecorvino Rovella (Province of Salerno) or the Caserta area. Alfonso and Angelina Chiarolanza brought their family (including Mary and her 4 sisters) to Bayonne, NJ, where Mary married Frank Elia, raised Yvonne and her siblings, worked at Maidenform, and later married Anthony Galella.*
