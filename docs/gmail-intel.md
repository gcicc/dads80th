## Vic's Voice — Direct Quotes from His Emails

These excerpts capture Vic's personality in his own words.

### After his 75th birthday party (Apr 6, 2021)
> "Dearest Greg, Valerie, Anthony, Noah and Hunter, thank you all so much for coming to my party. I am still laughing at your antics on the video. I can be walking around the house and suddenly I think of Greg and Val and man I start smiling then laughing. You guys did a great job, thank you ALL for coming to my party and I will be visiting you soon. Love DAD"

**Tribute note:** Vic is still laughing days later. The image of him walking around the house, suddenly smiling at a memory, is the kind of detail that belongs in the tribute book.

### Reacting to Greg's AbbVie offer (May 11, 2015)
> "Dearest Son, I hope you can take a long breath and exhale!!!! Congratulations for a job well done. I hope it satisfied all your expectations. It looks like a great start. The Lord has blessed you once more. Here's a big hug and a kiss. Mommy feels the same way and I am sure she will speak to you."

**Tribute note:** Classic Vic — faith, pride, physical affection ("big hug and a kiss"), and deferring to Yvonne ("Mommy feels the same way"). In the same email, he mentioned his aunt Yolanda had just died — mixing family joy with family grief in the same breath. That's a man who carries it all.

### Requesting an air pistol (Sep 11, 2021)
> "Greg do you think you could purchase this pistol for me for target practice, I would like some ammo as well. Let me know. Love DAD"

**Tribute note:** At 75, Vic forwarded a Heartland America ad for a Beeman Sportsman Deluxe Air Pistol ($49.99, .177 caliber). Still active, still shooting. The casual "Love DAD" sign-off on a request for ammo is peak Vic.

### Check-ins (2015)
- Subject: "How you doing?" — Body: empty. Just the subject line. Vic's communication style distilled.
- "What's happening? Did you hear from them? We are going to AC wed & thurs be back Fri pm. Call you later. Dad" — Atlantic City trips, staying in the loop on Greg's career moves.

### "The Gift of Time" (Nov 21, 2015)
Vic forwarded to Greg, Rich, and Mike Hurley (mbubbles44) a parable about Alexander the Great's deathbed wishes — the lesson being that time is the most precious gift. Forwarded through his veteran/friend network (Leon, David Connelly, Larry Messina, etc.).

**Tribute note:** Vic's philosophical side. He curates chain emails about life, time, and values — and sends them to his sons and nephew. The forward chain reveals his social network: a circle of older veterans and Bayonne-era friends sharing life wisdom.

### "Look at yourselves!!!!" (Sep 3, 2017)
Vic sent a family photo (P1020477.JPG, 5.5MB) to Rich, Natalie, and Greg. Four exclamation marks. No body text needed.

**Tribute note:** Proud dad/grandpa moment. The photo attachment is a potential asset for the tribute book.

## Career Milestones Greg Shared with Vic

These emails show what Greg chose to share with his parents — and how they responded.

### GSK Promotion Package (Jul 16, 2014)
Greg forwarded his manager Rich Davies' promotion proposal to Jen, Mom, and Dad. Included the full written case for Greg's promotion to Director of Clinical Statistics.

### Performance Review Dispute (Feb 8, 2015)
Greg forwarded a detailed, multi-page rebuttal letter to his GSK manager about a performance rating dispute. Sent to Mom and Dad. The letter argued his contributions were undervalued because senior leadership didn't know his work — despite his manager acknowledging "real, significant, tangible value."

**Tribute note:** Greg shared raw professional frustration with his parents. This level of trust — forwarding a workplace dispute letter — shows Vic and Yvonne were confidants, not just parents. Vic's role as sounding board for Greg's career decisions is a recurring pattern.

### AbbVie Offer Accepted (May 11, 2015)
Greg emailed both parents: "175k with 25k signing bonus. 3 weeks vacation. Amounts to 17.44% raise." Vic's response (above) was immediate and emotional.

### Promotion to Research Fellow (Jul 11, 2018)
Greg forwarded the company-wide announcement of his promotion to Research Fellow at AbbVie to Mom, Dad, and Rich. The announcement (from Walt Offen, Global Head of Statistical Sciences) detailed Greg's full career:
- Ph.D. from University of Connecticut, 2002
- Muhlenberg College faculty, 2002–2005
- GSK, 10 years, Director of Clinical Statistics
- AbbVie, 2015–present, promoted to Research Fellow
- Key work: ABBV-8E12 for Alzheimer's and PSP
- BIO Innovative Clinical Trials Taskforce representative
- 30+ colleague congratulations appended

**Tribute note:** This email is the most complete professional summary of Greg's career in the dataset. For the tribute book: "The son of a public school administrator and a health teacher became a Research Fellow in drug development — and the first people he told were Mom and Dad."

### Church & Confession Joke (Mar 2015)
Greg to Vic: "Jen wants kids to start going to church and CCD — I said 'My mother would love to join you — you can both go to confession together.'" Vic's reply not captured, but this shows the family's Catholic context and Greg's humor about it.

## Tribute Book Fuel — Key Themes from Gmail

1. **"Love DAD"** — Vic signs every email this way. It's his signature. Consider using it as a motif in the tribute book.

2. **The walk-around-the-house laugh** — After his 75th, Vic described randomly bursting into laughter at home remembering the party. This is a warm, human image for the tribute.

3. **Faith threading** — "The Lord has blessed you once more." Vic frames milestones through faith naturally, without preaching.

4. **Atlantic City regular** — Multiple references to AC trips ("going to AC wed & thurs"). Part of the NJ retirement lifestyle.

5. **Still sharp, still active** — Air pistol shopping at 75. Target practice. The man doesn't sit still.

6. **Wisdom curator** — Forwards chain emails about life philosophy (Alexander the Great / Gift of Time, political humor) to his sons and nephew. He sees himself as passing along lessons.

7. **Proudest moments visible in Gmail** — The three career emails Greg sent to Vic (GSK promotion, AbbVie offer, Research Fellow) are the moments where Vic's pride is most directly captured.

8. **75th → 80th continuity** — The 75th had JotForm + tribute video (Kathy/Keri Urban). The 80th has tribute PDF book (Greg organizing). Both follow the same pattern: the family assembles to honor Vic while he's unaware.
