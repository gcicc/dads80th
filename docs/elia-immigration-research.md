## Executive Summary

The Elia family of Bayonne, New Jersey represents a classic Italian-American immigration story. Research confirms the family is rooted in southern Italy (the surname Elia is most concentrated in Puglia, with secondary presence in Calabria, Campania, Sicily, and Abruzzo). The family settled in Bayonne's Italian-American community, likely in the Bergen Point / East Side neighborhood near Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church (39 E 22nd St). The family story involves immigration through Ellis Island, establishment in Bayonne's industrial waterfront community, early loss of the patriarch Frank Elia (~1962), Mary's remarriage to Anthony Galella, and the next generation's deep roots in Bayonne through the Hurley family (police, fitness, development).

## Surname Analysis

### Elia
- **Origin:** Italian (southern), from the personal name Elia, equivalent of Elias/Elijah (Hebrew: "My God is Yahweh")
- **Concentration in Italy:** Greatest in **Puglia**, with significant presence in **Calabria, Campania, Abruzzo, Sicily, and Friuli-Venezia Giulia**
- **Prevalence:** ~15,958 bearers in Italy
- **In the US:** Most concentrated in northeastern states with Italian immigrant communities

### Chiarolanza (Mary Elia's maiden name)
- **Origin:** Italian (Campania), compound name: *chiara* ("bright, clear") + *lanza* ("lance")
- **Meaning:** "Bright Lance" -- likely a medieval nickname or occupational name
- **Concentration in Italy:** 88% in **Campania**, 4% Piedmont, 2% Lazio
- **Prevalence:** ~1,032 bearers in Italy, ~150 in USA (~1,268 worldwide)
- **Origin town:** **Montecorvino Rovella**, Province of Salerno, Campania (per Antenati Italiani)
- **Also recorded in:** Caserta, Campania (1849 marriage record on WikiTree)
- **Full research:** See `docs/chirolanza-research.md`

### Galella (Anthony Galella's surname)
- **Origin:** Italian, variant of Gallello, a pet form of the name Gallo
- **Concentration in Italy:** Specific to **Catanzaro province, Calabria**
- **Prevalence:** Rare -- only ~462 bearers in the US
- **Significance:** The Galella surname's specificity to Catanzaro, Calabria is a strong indicator that Anthony Galella's family came from that exact region

### Asenza/Assenza (Salvatore Elia's mother's surname)
- **Origin:** Italian (Sicilian), from "assenza" meaning "absence"
- **Concentration in Italy:** **85% in Sicily**, 6% Lombardy, 3% Liguria
- **Significance:** Confirms Sicilian connection in the broader Elia family network in Bayonne. Maria Ninna Asenza (mother of Salvatore Elia, b. 1921) was almost certainly from Sicily.

## The Galella Family (Yvonne's Stepfather's Side)

### Known Galella Family Members in the Bayonne Area

| Person | Key Facts |
|--------|-----------|
| **Anthony Galella** | Yvonne's stepfather. Married Mary Elia after Frank Elia's death (~1962). Greg named his son Anthony after him. NOT the same as Anthony J. Galella Jr. (d. 2024, married to Rosemary) or Anthony Galella (1951-1991, buried Gate of Heaven, Hawthorne NY). |
| **Nicholas Anthony Galella** (d. 2022) | Born Jun 6, 1937, Jersey City, NJ. Parents: **Joseph and Anna Galella**. Graduate of St. Peter's Prep, Villanova University. US Air Force veteran. Formally of Bayonne, died in Virginia Beach, VA. May be a brother or relative of Anthony Galella. |
| **Anthony J. "Tony" Galella Jr.** (d. 2024) | Age 80, of Jackson NJ. Longtime Bayonne resident. Vietnam-era Army veteran. Career at AT&T (draftsman, Power Engineer, Quality Engineer), then Tyco. Retired 2004. Wife of 57 years: Rosemary. Buried at BG William C. Doyle Veterans Memorial Cemetery. This is a DIFFERENT Anthony Galella. |

### Galella Patriarch (Jersey City/Bayonne)
Joseph and Anna Galella of Jersey City are the parents of Nicholas Anthony Galella. Given the Galella surname's rarity and its concentration in Catanzaro, Calabria, the family almost certainly emigrated from that specific province.

## The Immigration Story: What We Can Reconstruct

### Timeline Estimate

Based on known facts and typical Italian immigration patterns:

| Period | Event |
|--------|-------|
| **~1890-1920** | Peak Italian immigration to NJ. The Elia family patriarch(s) likely arrived at Ellis Island during this window. Bayonne was industrializing rapidly (Standard Oil, 6,000+ workers by 1920s). |
| **~1920-1935** | **RESOLVED:** Mary Chiarolanza (born ~1920 in Italy) immigrated with her father Alfonso, mother Angelina, and 4 sisters. The family settled in Bayonne, NJ. By the 1940 Census, the full Chiarolanza household was in Bayonne. See `docs/chirolanza-research.md`. |
| **~1910s-1920s** | The Elia family established in Bayonne. Salvatore Elia born Dec 22, 1921 in NJ to Maria Ninna Asenza -- confirming Elia family was already in NJ by 1921. |
| **~1940s** | Frank Elia and Mary married (likely at Our Lady of Mount Carmel or Assumption Church). |
| **~April 1948** | Yvonne C. Elia born, Bayonne. |
| **~1962** | Frank Elia dies. Mary later remarries Anthony Galella. |

4. **Ancestry.com** (subscription) -- "New York, U.S., Arriving Passenger and Crew Lists, 1820-1957." Also: 1930 and 1940 Census for Bayonne/Hudson County to find the complete Elia household.

### The Church Connection

The Elia and Cicconetti families were parishioners of Catholic churches in Bayonne:
- **Our Lady of the Assumption** (where Yvonne and Victor married, Aug 20, 1967)
- **Our Lady of Mount Carmel** (the Italian parish, est. 1899, at 39 E 22nd St -- very close to the Elia family at 18 E 32nd St)
- Both churches merged in 2016 into **St. John Paul II Parish** (39 E 22nd St, Bayonne, NJ 07002, phone 973-761-9126)
- **Archdiocese of Newark** holds sacramental records: archives@rcan.org

Church records (baptisms, marriages, deaths) often contain parents' names, birthplaces in Italy, and godparent information that can trace back to specific Italian towns.

## Geography: Where the Elias Lived in Bayonne

Bayonne is a 1.2-square-mile peninsula in Hudson County, NJ, bordered by Newark Bay, Kill Van Kull, and New York Bay. The city's Italian-American community concentrated in the area around Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church.

### Known Elia Addresses
- **18 E 32nd St, Bayonne** -- Salvatore F. & Eileen Elia (current). Block 154, Lot 38. Bergen Point neighborhood.
- **158 W 21st St, Bayonne** -- Frank & Valerie Elia (current).

### Proximity
- Our Lady of Mount Carmel: 39 E 22nd St (the Italian parish)
- Assumption Church: Avenue C & 21st St
- Forum Fitness Club: 21 W 25th St (Kathy Pacifico's business)
- Bayonne Police Department: Broadway & 25th St

All within a ~15-block radius. This is a family that never left the neighborhood.

## Open Questions for Owner (Greg)

1. **~~What was Mary Elia's maiden name?~~** **RESOLVED: CHIAROLANZA** (family spelling: Chirolanza). See `docs/chirolanza-research.md`. Remaining: What are the 4 sisters' names? (Requires 1940 Census image access.)

2. **Is Salvatore F. Elia (age ~82, 18 E 32nd St, Bayonne) a relative?** He could be Frank Elia's brother (born ~1943 vs Frank's estimated birth ~1910s-1920s -- so possibly a much younger brother, or a nephew). His listed relatives include "Francesco Elia" which is the Italian form of "Frank."

3. **Is the living Frank Elia (158 W 21st St, married to the late Ruth Ann Osborne) Yvonne's brother, cousin, or nephew?** He was on the 80th birthday tribute email list ("Valerie & Frank Elia").

4. **What was Anthony Galella's approximate birth year and death year?** This would help distinguish him from other Anthony Galellas in the records.

5. **Did Mary Ann Hurley's pizza bistro have a name?** This would help confirm business records.

6. **Does Leanora Cicconetti (Victor's sister, Rev., genealogy enthusiast) have any Elia family research?** She is active in NJ genealogy groups and might have already traced the Italian origins.

7. **What Italian town did the Elia family come from?** Even a regional clue (Puglia? Calabria? Sicily?) would dramatically narrow the Ellis Island search.

8. **Did Mary live in Stafford Township with Mary Ann, or somewhere else after leaving Bayonne?**
