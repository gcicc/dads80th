## Executive Summary

The Cicconetti family traces its roots to **Collepietro, L'Aquila, Abruzzo, Italy** -- a tiny hilltop village of fewer than 200 inhabitants in the mountainous interior of central-southern Italy. The family has been documented in Collepietro since at least the late 1700s. Victor's mother Eleanor was born Eleanor Salone, daughter of **Joseph (Giuseppe) Salone** and **Anna (Nunziana Castro) Salone**, immigrants from Italy who settled on the Lower East Side of Manhattan before the family relocated to Bayonne.

Victor R. Cicconetti (born ~March 1946) is the son of Victor Cicconetti Sr. (1925-1980) and Eleanor (Salone) Cicconetti (d. 1997). The immigrant generation -- Victor Sr.'s parents/grandparents -- arrived from Italy likely between 1890 and 1920 during the great wave of Italian emigration from the Mezzogiorno and Abruzzo regions.

## Part 1: The Cicconetti Name

### Etymology
The surname **Cicconetti** is of Roman-Latin origin. It derives from "Franciscus" (Francis), which originally meant "a Frank" or "a free man." The name evolved through Italian diminutive forms: Francesco > Cicco > Cicconetti. Related surname variants include Ciccolini, Ciccone, Ciccotti, and Zecchi. The "-etti" suffix is a diminutive, suggesting "little Cicco" or "son of Cicco."

The surname has been documented since at least the 12th century across Italy, with the Cicconetti branch concentrated in the **Abruzzo** region.

### Geographic Distribution in Italy
Cicconetti families are documented in two Abruzzo locations:
- **Collepietro, Province of L'Aquila** -- the primary ancestral seat
- **Pianella, Province of Pescara** -- a secondary branch
- **Campli, Province of Teramo** -- additional records

All three towns are in the Abruzzo region, confirming this as the Cicconetti heartland.

## Part 2: Collepietro -- The Ancestral Village

### Geography
- **Full name:** Collepietro, Provincia dell'Aquila, Abruzzo, Italy
- **Altitude:** 849 meters (2,785 feet) above sea level
- **Current population:** ~199 inhabitants (one of Italy's smallest municipalities)
- **Location:** Interior of Abruzzo, in the Apennine Mountains east of Rome
- **Historical jurisdiction:** Part of the Kingdom of Naples until Italian unification (1861); formerly in the province of Abruzzo Ultra II

### Character
Collepietro is a classic Abruzzese hilltop village -- stone houses clustered on a mountain ridge, surrounded by pastoral land. The village is so small that its entire population today would fit in a single city block of Bayonne. The contrast between this ancient mountain village and the industrial waterfront city of Bayonne, New Jersey, is the very essence of the Italian-American immigration story.

### Top Surnames in Collepietro
The five most common surnames historically recorded in Collepietro are:
1. Tomassetti
2. **Di Scipio** (connected to Cicconetti family -- see genealogy below)
3. Di Iorio
4. Grande
5. Nolletti

The Cicconetti name, while not in the top five, is documented in Collepietro records going back to at least 1778.

### Civil Records
Registry offices were established in Collepietro in 1809 under Napoleonic-era reforms. Birth, marriage, and death records from that date forward are held in the Comune di Collepietro (Via Roma, 7, 67020 Collepietro AQ) and in the Archivio di Stato di L'Aquila.

## Part 3: The Cicconetti Family Tree in Italy (WikiTree / Ancestry Records)

The following Cicconetti family members have been documented in public genealogy databases, all rooted in Collepietro:

### Earliest Known Ancestor
| Name | Born | Died | Location | Spouse |
|------|------|------|----------|--------|
| **Camillo Giovanni Cicconetti** | 1778 | 1850 | Collepietro, L'Aquila | Maria Consiglia Iannarelli (m. Aug 11, 1822) |

Camillo Giovanni is the earliest documented Cicconetti ancestor. He and Maria Consiglia Iannarelli had multiple children, including:

### Children of Camillo Giovanni Cicconetti (1778-1850)
| Name | Born | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Domenico Antonio Cicconetti | 1819 | Died 1820 (infant) |
| Degnamata Cicconetti | ? | |
| Angela Nicola Cicconetti | ? | |
| **Ignazio Cicconetti** | ? | Father of the next generation |
| Giovanna Cicconetti | ? | |
| Giovanni Cicconetti | ? | |

### Next Generation
| Name | Born | Died | Location | Parents | Spouse |
|------|------|------|----------|---------|--------|
| **Camillo Cicconetti** | 1843 | ? | Collepietro | Ignazio Cicconetti & Giustina Di Scipio | ? |
| **Nicolangelo Cicconetti** | ? | ? | Collepietro | (likely son of Ignazio or sibling) | Maria Maddalena Di Scipio |

### Generation Born ~1860s
| Name | Born | Died | Location | Parents | Notes |
|------|------|------|----------|---------|-------|
| **Domenico Cicconetti** | Jan 3, 1865 | Dec 9, 1901 | Collepietro | Nicolangelo Cicconetti & Maria Maddalena Di Scipio | Married Aurora D'Alfonzo; 5 children |
| **Camillo Cicconetti** | Sep 6, 1863 | ? | Pianella, Pescara | Ignazio Cicconetti & Liberata Di Girolamo | Different Ignazio or relocated branch |

### Key Observation: The Di Scipio Connection
The surname **Di Scipio** appears twice in the Cicconetti tree (as Giustina Di Scipio and Maria Maddalena Di Scipio) and is also one of the top 5 surnames in Collepietro. This suggests deep intermarriage between the Cicconetti and Di Scipio families in this small village -- a common pattern in Italian hill towns where a few families constituted the entire population.

---

## Part 4: The Immigration Generation

### The Great Wave from Abruzzo
Between 1880 and 1920, approximately 500,000 Abruzzesi left Italy for the Americas. The factors driving emigration from towns like Collepietro included:
- Extreme poverty in the mountainous interior
- Limited agricultural land at high altitude
- Lack of industrial employment
- Inheritance laws that fragmented land holdings
- The promise of wage labor in American cities

Abruzzese immigrants typically settled in:
- New York City (especially Lower Manhattan, Brooklyn)
- New Jersey (Newark, Jersey City, Bayonne, Trenton)
- Western Pennsylvania
- Ohio (Cleveland, Youngstown)

### Giovanni Cicconetti (born 1886)
FamilySearch records document a **Giovanni Cicconetti born in 1886** -- likely born in Collepietro and a member of the generation that emigrated. This Giovanni could potentially be Victor Sr.'s father or a close relative. The timing (born 1886, would have emigrated ~1900-1910, could have fathered Victor Sr. born 1925) fits the generational pattern.

### Domenico Cicconetti (1890-1971) -- New Jersey Connection
A **Domenico Cicconetti** born February 19, 1890 and died April 1971 is documented as having lived in **Marlton, Burlington County, New Jersey**. This is the first confirmed Cicconetti in New Jersey in public records and may represent the immigrant generation or their immediate descendants. Marlton is ~80 miles south of Bayonne, but family networks in New Jersey often spread across the state.

### Domenico Cicconetti (1897-1958) -- Campli Branch
A separate **Domenico Cicconetti** born November 11, 1897 in Campli, Teramo, Abruzzo (son of Angelo Cicconetti and Filomena Di Adoardo) married Julia Di Bonaventura and died August 8, 1958 in Rome, Italy. This represents a different branch from the Teramo province.

### The Missing Link: Victor Sr.'s Parents
**Victor Cicconetti Sr. was born in 1925 in Bayonne, NJ.** His parents -- Victor R. Cicconetti's paternal grandparents -- were almost certainly either:
- Italian immigrants who arrived between ~1900-1920, or
- First-generation Italian-Americans born to immigrants who arrived in the 1890s-1900s

The Michael C. Cicconetti obituary (2009) lists grandparents as **"Joseph & Anna Algamise"** -- but this appears to refer to *Eleanor's* parents (maternal grandparents), not the Cicconetti paternal grandparents. The obituary's phrasing "predeceased by his parents, Eleanor (Salone) & Victor Cicconetti; his brother Dennis; and his grandparents, Joseph & Anna Algamise" likely means the Algamise grandparents were Eleanor's parents' parents (i.e., great-grandparents or the known surviving grandparents at the time).

**CORRECTION/CLARIFICATION NEEDED:** The Margaret Barbagallo tribute page clarifies that Eleanor's parents were **Joseph (Giuseppe) Salone** and **Anna (Nunziana Castro) Salone**. The "Algamise" grandparents listed in Michael's obituary may be a *different* set of grandparents -- possibly Victor Sr.'s parents, with "Algamise" being a married name or an error. This requires further investigation. See Part 5.

---

## Part 5: Eleanor's Side -- The Salone Family

### The Salone Sisters
Eleanor Cicconetti (nee Salone) was one of **three Salone sisters**:

| Name | Born | Died | Married Name | Notes |
|------|------|------|-------------|-------|
| **Marge (Margaret) Salone** | Oct 5, 1929 | Oct 17, 2004 | Barbagallo | Middle sister; married Leo Barbagallo; moved from Manhattan to Bayonne, NJ in 1959 |
| **Eleanor Salone** | ~1920s-1930s | 1997 | Cicconetti | Married Victor Cicconetti Sr.; mother of Victor R. and five siblings |
| **Josie (Josephine) Salone** | ? | ? | ? | Third sister |

### Parents
- **Father:** Joseph (Giuseppe) Salone
- **Mother:** Anna (Nunziana Castro) Salone

The Salone family lived on the **Lower East Side of Manhattan** -- one of the great Italian-American neighborhoods of New York.

### Hardship During the Depression
During the 1930s Great Depression, the Salone family experienced severe hardship. All three daughters spent time in an **orphanage** until their mother Anna could secure employment as a **sweatshop seamstress** and bring them back home. Despite this difficult start, all three sisters entered the NYC public school system and went on to build stable lives.

### Connection to Bayonne
When Marge Salone Barbagallo became pregnant with twins (Lori and Ron) in 1959, her family moved from Manhattan to **Bayonne, New Jersey** -- likely following her sister Eleanor and brother-in-law Victor Sr., who were already established there. This is a classic Italian-American pattern: one family member establishes a foothold, and siblings follow.

### The Algamise Mystery
Michael C. Cicconetti's obituary lists his grandparents as "Joseph & Anna Algamise." However, the Margaret Barbagallo tribute identifies the Salone sisters' parents as Joseph and Anna (Nunziana Castro) Salone. Possible explanations:
1. "Algamise" may be Anna's maiden name (Anna Algamise married Joseph Salone)
2. "Algamise" may be an alternate spelling or anglicization of an Italian surname
3. There may have been a second marriage
4. The obituary may contain an error

**Most likely:** Anna's maiden name was Algamise (or similar), and she married Joseph Salone. So the grandparents were Joseph Salone and Anna (Algamise) Salone. This would make Eleanor's full maiden name Eleanor Salone, daughter of Joseph Salone and Anna Algamise.

## Part 6: The Cicconetti Six -- Updated from Obituary Research

Michael C. Cicconetti's 2009 obituary provides the definitive listing of Victor R. Cicconetti's siblings:

| Name | Birth Year | Death | Spouse | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|--------|-------|
| **Victor R. Cicconetti** | ~1946 | Living | Yvonne (nee Elia) | The birthday honoree |
| **Dennis Cicconetti** | ? | Pre-2009 | ? | **Predeceased Michael** (died before March 2009) |
| **Rev. Leanora Cicconetti** | ~1958-1959 | Living | Clavelli (married name) | Reverend; also known as Leanora Clavelli, age 67; active in NJ genealogy |
| **Robert (Bob) Cicconetti** | ? | Living | **Retired Lt. Col. Elizabeth** | Wife Elizabeth is a retired military officer (Lt. Col.) |
| **Loretta Keating** (nee Cicconetti) | ? | ~2025 | **Louis Keating** | Husband's first name confirmed as Louis |
| **Michael C. Cicconetti** | 1961 | Mar 10, 2009 | Karen Haraksin | One son: Christopher; lived in Carteret, NJ |

### Key New Information
1. **Dennis is deceased** -- he predeceased Michael, so he died before March 2009. He was previously listed as status unknown.
2. **Robert's wife Elizabeth is a retired Lieutenant Colonel** -- a military career of distinction.
3. **Loretta's husband is Louis Keating** -- first name confirmed.
4. **Leanora's married name is Clavelli** -- she is approximately 67 years old (born ~1958-1959).
5. **Michael was born in 1961** (age 47 at death in 2009).

### Michael C. Cicconetti Details
- Born: 1961, Bayonne, NJ
- Died: March 10, 2009, at his home
- Residence: Carteret, NJ (since 1996)
- Wife: Karen Haraksin Cicconetti (died September 4, 2011, age 48)
- Son: Christopher Cicconetti
- Burial: Cremated; location of ashes unknown
- Funeral: Sweeney Funeral Home, Bayonne; Mass at St. Joseph's Church, Carteret, NJ
- Karen's parents: Robert J. Haraksin and Elizabeth Wallace Haraksin-Scaglione

## Part 7: The Ohio Cicconettis -- A Separate Branch

Research uncovered a prominent Cicconetti family in **Ohio** that appears to be a separate branch, not directly related to the Bayonne family (though they may share distant Italian ancestry):

| Name | Years | Location | Notes |
|------|-------|----------|-------|
| Justin Arthur "Art" Cicconetti | 1925-2016 | New Philadelphia, OH | Buried at Calvary Cemetery, Tuscarawas County |
| Lillian F. (Cicconetti) Stone | ? | Ohio | Sister of Art |
| **Judge Michael A. Cicconetti** | b. Apr 24, 1951 | Painesville, Lake County, OH | Famous "creative justice" judge; retired 2019; oldest of 9 siblings |

Judge Michael A. Cicconetti of Ohio is *not* the same person as Michael C. Cicconetti of Bayonne/Carteret (Victor's brother). The Ohio Cicconettis likely emigrated from the same Abruzzo region but settled in northeastern Ohio rather than New Jersey.

---

## Part 8: Immigration Pathway -- Reconstructed Narrative

Based on all available evidence, the Cicconetti immigration story can be reconstructed as follows:

### The Italian Setting (~pre-1900)
The Cicconettis lived in **Collepietro**, a tiny stone village perched at 2,785 feet in the Apennine Mountains of Abruzzo, about 70 miles northeast of Rome. The family had been there for generations -- documented back to at least **Camillo Giovanni Cicconetti (1778-1850)**. They intermarried with other village families, especially the **Di Scipio** and **Iannarelli** clans.

Life in Collepietro was hard. The village sat in the shadow of the Gran Sasso massif, Italy's highest Apennine peak. The soil was thin, the winters harsh, and opportunities few. After Italian unification in 1861 disrupted the old Kingdom of Naples structures, and as land fragmented through inheritance, young men began leaving for America.

### The Crossing (~1900-1915)
Members of the Cicconetti family -- likely including a Giovanni (born 1886) or a close relative -- would have:
1. Traveled from Collepietro down to **Naples** (the nearest major port, ~150 miles south)
2. Boarded a steamship at the **Porto di Napoli**
3. Crossed the Atlantic in steerage class (~10-14 days)
4. Arrived at **Ellis Island**, New York Harbor
5. Passed through immigration inspection
6. Settled initially in the Italian neighborhoods of **New York City** or **northern New Jersey**

### Settlement in Bayonne
The immigrants made their way to **Bayonne, New Jersey** -- a city on a peninsula between Newark Bay and New York Harbor. Bayonne was an industrial powerhouse with oil refineries, shipyards, and factories that offered steady wage labor to new arrivals. By 1920, Italians constituted a significant portion of Bayonne's population (eventually reaching 20.1% by the 2000 census).

Italian immigrants in Bayonne settled in clusters by region of origin -- "paesani" from the same village or province living near each other for social and economic support. The Cicconettis would have been part of an Abruzzese network within Bayonne's broader Italian community.

### The American-Born Generation
**Victor Cicconetti Sr.** was born in **1925** in Bayonne -- a first- or second-generation American. He grew up in the Depression era, came of age during World War II, and raised his own family of six children in the same city where his parents (or grandparents) had first arrived from Italy.

Victor Sr. died in **1980** at approximately age 55 -- relatively young, leaving his children (including Victor R., then about 34) without a father for the second half of their lives.

### Victor R. Cicconetti (born ~March 1946)
Victor was born into this Bayonne Italian-American world. He grew up in a household shaped by immigrant values -- hard work, family loyalty, Catholic faith, and the conviction that America offered opportunities that Collepietro never could. His mother Eleanor brought the Salone family's Lower East Side Manhattan toughness; his father Victor Sr. carried the Cicconetti name from the mountains of Abruzzo.

## Part 9: Research Gaps & Recommended Next Steps

### What We Still Need

1. **Victor Sr.'s parents' names** -- The paternal grandparents (the immigrant generation) are the biggest gap. The 2009 obituary only lists maternal grandparents. Options:
   - Search the **1930 Federal Census** for Cicconetti households in Bayonne (Victor Sr. would be age 5)
   - Search the **1940 Federal Census** (Victor Sr. age 15)
   - Request **Victor Cicconetti Sr.'s death certificate** (NJ, 1980) -- would list parents
   - Request **Victor Cicconetti Sr.'s marriage certificate** -- would list parents
   - Contact **Rev. Leanora Cicconetti/Clavelli** -- she is active in NJ genealogy groups and may have already done this research

2. **Ellis Island passenger records** -- Search statueofliberty.org for "Cicconetti" arrivals at the Port of New York. The database covers 1820-1957.

3. **Naturalization records** -- The Hudson County Clerk's Office holds naturalization records from 1840-1989. A search for Cicconetti naturalization petitions would reveal the immigrant's Italian birthplace and arrival date.

4. **Dennis Cicconetti's obituary** -- He predeceased Michael (before 2009) but no obituary was found online. Local newspaper archives (Bayonne Times, Jersey Journal) or GenealogyBank may have it.

5. **Victor Cicconetti Sr.'s obituary (1980)** -- Not digitized online. Would need to be found in:
   - Bayonne Times archives (1980)
   - Jersey Journal archives
   - GenealogyBank or Newspapers.com (subscription required)

6. **Eleanor Cicconetti's obituary (1997)** -- Same situation; not found online.

7. **Italian civil records from Collepietro** -- Available from the Comune di Collepietro or through the Italian state archives portal (antenati.cultura.gov.it). A professional genealogist like Emidio Spinogatti at abruzzogenealogy.com specializes in this exact region.

8. **Loretta Keating obituary (~2025)** -- Search did not find it; may be too recent to be fully indexed, or may be under a different name/location.

## Part 10: For the Tribute Book -- Narrative Thread

### "From the Mountains of Abruzzo to the Streets of Bayonne"

*In a stone village called Collepietro, perched nearly 3,000 feet up in Italy's Apennine Mountains, the Cicconetti family lived for generations. The village was tiny -- fewer than 200 people even today. Everyone knew everyone. The Cicconettis married the Di Scipios and the Iannarellis, the same families they had known for centuries.*

*But in the late 1800s, the old ways could no longer sustain the young. Italy had unified, the old Kingdom of Naples was gone, and the mountain villages offered nothing but thin soil and hard winters. So like half a million other Abruzzesi, the Cicconettis made the journey -- down from the mountains to the port of Naples, across the Atlantic in the belly of a steamship, through the gates of Ellis Island, and into the teeming streets of New York and New Jersey.*

*They landed in Bayonne -- a city of oil refineries and shipyards on a narrow peninsula jutting into New York Harbor. Here, among other Italian families from Abruzzo and beyond, they rebuilt. They worked. They raised families. They became Americans.*

*Victor Cicconetti Sr. was born in Bayonne in 1925 -- a son of that immigrant generation. He married Eleanor Salone, whose own family had clawed their way up from the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where her mother Anna had worked as a sweatshop seamstress to keep her three daughters out of an orphanage. Together, Victor and Eleanor raised six children in Bayonne: Victor, Dennis, Leanora, Bob, Loretta, and Michael.*

*Their eldest, Victor R. Cicconetti, was born in March 1946 -- the first year after the war, a baby boomer in every sense. From those Bayonne streets, from that Italian-American kitchen, from that family forged by immigration and hardship and faith, Victor would go on to serve his country in Vietnam, build a career in education, raise a family of his own, and never stop moving forward.*

*The mountains of Collepietro are a long way from the Jersey Shore. But the Cicconetti story -- from stone village to American suburb, from immigrant struggle to family legacy -- is the story of millions of Italian Americans. And on his 80th birthday, it is Victor's story to celebrate.*
