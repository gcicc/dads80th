    "text": "NoteThe Bigger Picture: Why 4 Million Italians Left\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wide lens: Between 1880 and 1924, over four million Italians emigrated to the United States — the largest single-nationality migration in American history. They were overwhelmingly from the Mezzogiorno (the south): Campania, Calabria, Sicily, Abruzzo, Puglia. Italy had unified in 1861, but unification made things worse for the south. Northern industrialists taxed southern agriculture to fund northern factories. Inheritance laws divided farms into smaller and smaller plots until a family couldn’t feed itself on what it owned.\nPush factors: Poverty. Malaria. Cholera. Earthquakes (Messina, 1908: 75,000 dead). A feudal land system that hadn’t changed in centuries. The contadini (peasant farmers) had no path forward.\nPull factors: American industry needed labor. Steel mills, coal mines, railroads, oil refineries, garment factories — all of it demanded bodies willing to work for wages that, while pitiful by American standards, dwarfed anything available in a stone village in the Apennines. Letters home from relatives already in America — the lettere di richiamo — described a world where work was hard but food was plentiful and a man could own a house.\nThe numbers: In peak years (1900–1914), over 200,000 southern Italians arrived annually at Ellis Island. The flow was so enormous that entire villages depopulated. Collepietro — the Cicconetti homeland — has fewer than 200 residents today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteThe Journey: Steerage Class to Ellis Island\n\n\n\n\n\nThe middle lens — what the crossing actually looked like:\nThe journey began with a walk. From mountain villages like Collepietro, families traveled by mule or on foot to the nearest rail station, then by train to Naples — the great embarkation port for southern Italians. There, emigration agents processed their paperwork and sold them passage.\nThe ship: Steerage class. The cheapest tickets (roughly $30 — about $1,000 today). Passengers were packed below the waterline in open compartments with tiered metal bunks, no ventilation, and one toilet per hundred people. The crossing took 12 to 17 days. Seasickness was universal. Many had never seen the ocean before boarding.\nEllis Island: The Statue of Liberty appeared first — most immigrants saw her from the deck of the ship, crowded against the railing. Then the ferry to Ellis Island. Then the Great Hall: a vast, echoing room where thousands waited in metal-railed lines, clutching their documents.\nThe inspection had three stages:\n\nMedical exam — Doctors watched immigrants climb the stairs to the Great Hall, looking for limps, labored breathing, signs of disease. The dreaded “buttonhook men” used a small hook to flip back eyelids, checking for trachoma (an eye disease that meant automatic deportation). A chalk mark on your coat — X for mental deficiency, H for heart, L for limp — sent you to a detention room.\nLegal inspection — An officer asked 29 questions: name, age, occupation, final destination, how much money you carried (you needed at least $25), whether anyone was meeting you, whether you’d ever been in prison. Interpreters translated. The whole interview lasted about two minutes.\nThe Staircase of Separation — Three aisles. Left: New York. Center: detained for further review. Right: New Jersey ferry. Families who’d survived the crossing together could be separated here in an instant.\n\nThe success rate: About 98% of immigrants who reached Ellis Island were admitted. But that 2% rejection rate — roughly 250,000 people between 1892 and 1924 — meant that every person in that line knew it could happen to them. Ellis Island’s Italian nickname was L’Isola delle Lacrime — the Island of Tears.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteUS Immigration Policy: The Door Opens, Then Closes\n\n\n\n\n\nThe policy lens:\n\n1882: First federal immigration law. Barred “lunatics, idiots, and persons likely to become a public charge.”\n1892: Ellis Island opens as the federal immigration station. Before this, states ran their own processing (Castle Garden in Manhattan handled New York).\n1907: Peak year — 1.25 million immigrants processed through Ellis Island. Over 100 nationalities. The building was designed for 500,000.\n1917: Literacy test required. Immigrants had to read 30–40 words in their native language. This hit southern Italians hard — many were illiterate.\n1921: Emergency Quota Act. First numerical limit on immigration. Capped each nationality at 3% of its 1910 Census population in the US.\n1924: Johnson-Reed Act. Slashed quotas to 2% of the 1890 Census — deliberately targeting southern and eastern Europeans. Italian immigration dropped from 200,000/year to under 4,000. The door slammed shut.\n\nThe Cicconettis and the Chiarolanzas made it through before the door closed. Had they waited a decade, this story would never have happened.",

    "section": "From Italy to Bayonne",
    "text": "From Italy to Bayonne\n\n\n\nThe Cicconettis\nOrigin: Collepietro, Province of L’Aquila, Abruzzo — a stone village perched at 2,785 feet in the Apennine Mountains, fewer than 200 inhabitants even today.\nThe name: Cicconetti derives from Franciscus (“a free man”) through Italian diminutives: Francesco → Cicco → Cicconetti — “little Cicco.” Documented in Collepietro since at least 1778, when Camillo Giovanni Cicconetti married Maria Consiglia Iannarelli.\nThe pronunciation — and the war over it: In Italian, Cicconetti is pronounced with a hard ch: “Chee-ko-NET-tee.” That’s how the old country said it. That’s how part of the family still says it. But Vic was adamant: the name gets the Americanized soft C — “Sih-ko-NET-tee.”\nIt wasn’t vanity. It was survival. Growing up in Bayonne, a kid with a name that started with “Chick-” was a sitting duck. “Hey, Chicken Head, get over here!” — the playground taunts that Italian-American kids absorbed like body blows. Every strange surname was ammunition. Every rolled R was a target. The children of immigrants learned fast: you either Americanize or you fight every single day.\nVic chose to Americanize. The soft C was a declaration: I am from here. This is my country. Say my name the way I tell you to say it. It was the same instinct that drove the whole immigrant project — don’t just arrive, belong. Don’t just survive, assimilate. And if the old-country pronunciation has to bend to make that happen, then it bends.\nTo this day, the family is split. Some Cicconettis use the Italian pronunciation. Some use Vic’s Americanized version. It’s a tiny civil war that plays out every time someone new asks, “How do you say your last name?” — and the answer depends on which branch you’re talking to.\nWhy they left: Between 1880 and 1920, half a million Abruzzesi left Italy. The soil was thin, the winters harsh, inheritance laws fragmented the land. Young men traveled down from the mountains to Naples, boarded steamships, crossed the Atlantic in steerage, and passed through Ellis Island.\nWhere they landed: Bayonne, New Jersey — a city of oil refineries and shipyards on a narrow peninsula jutting into New York Harbor. By 1920, Italians constituted over 20% of the population. The Cicconettis settled among other Abruzzese paesani, near Assumption Catholic Church.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Elias & Chiarolanzas\nOrigin: The Elia surname traces to southern Italy — most concentrated in Puglia, with presence in Calabria, Campania, and Sicily. Yvonne’s mother Mary carried the surname Chiarolanza (Americanized to “Chirolanza”) — a rare name meaning “Bright Lance” (chiara + lanza), rooted in Montecorvino Rovella, Province of Salerno, Campania.\nThe crossing: The 1940 Census found Mary Chiarolanza, age 20, in Bayonne with her father Alfonso, mother Angelina, and four sisters. They had emigrated from Campania and passed through Ellis Island.\nWhere they landed: The same city. Bayonne. The Elia family settled near Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church (established 1899) — the heart of the Italian community, just blocks from the Cicconettis. Mary Chiarolanza went to work as a seamstress at the Maidenform factory at 154 Avenue E — Bayonne’s largest employer, where Italian-American women sewed garments (and during WWII, parachutes and carrier pigeon vests).\nFrank Elia — who worked as a poultry processor in Bayonne’s live markets — married Mary Chiarolanza.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCheck Our Work — The Old Country\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\nWe wrote…\nTRUE\nFALSE\nI DON’T KNOW\n\n\n\n\n1\nThe Cicconetti name traces to Collepietro, Abruzzo\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nThe Chiarolanza family came from Campania, likely Montecorvino Rovella\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nMary Chiarolanza worked at the Maidenform factory\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nFrank Elia worked as a poultry processor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything wrong? Fill in what we missed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipTell Us a Story\n\n\n\nDad: What kind of trouble did you get into growing up in Bayonne? Did you and Dennis ever do something your parents still don’t know about?\nMom: What’s the dish your mother made that nobody since has gotten right? Close your eyes — what does the old kitchen smell like?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteMap: Bayonne — Where Two Families Lived\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cicconettis and the Elias lived within blocks of each other. This map shows Victor’s childhood addresses, both family churches, the Maidenform factory, and Ellis Island — where it all began.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBayonne: Why Here?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe local lens — why two Italian families ended up on this specific peninsula:\nBayonne, New Jersey sits on a narrow spit of land between Newark Bay and New York Harbor — 1.2 square miles, surrounded by water on three sides. In the early 1900s, it was an industrial powerhouse: Standard Oil had its largest refinery here (the smell of petroleum was the smell of the city), Maidenform sewed bras and girdles (and during WWII, parachutes), and shipyards along the Kill Van Kull built vessels for the Navy.\nIndustry meant jobs. Jobs meant immigrants. By 1920, Bayonne was over 20% Italian, with clusters from specific regions: Abruzzesi near Assumption Church, Campanians near Our Lady of Mount Carmel. This wasn’t random — it was chain migration. One man from Collepietro gets a job at the refinery, writes a letter home, and his cousin follows. Then his cousin’s cousin. Within a generation, an entire village has relocated to a ten-block radius in New Jersey.\nThe Italian neighborhoods had their own economy: bakeries, butchers, live poultry markets (where Frank Elia worked), vegetable gardens in tiny backyards, wine made in basements. The old people spoke Italian; the children spoke English at school and Italian at home. The church was the center of everything — feast days, weddings, funerals, Sunday Mass, the social calendar of a community that had transplanted itself 4,000 miles but kept its roots.",

    "section": "The Unspoken Rule",
    "text": "The Unspoken Rule\nNobody sat you down and explained it. There was no speech, no family meeting, no written contract. But every Italian-American kid who grew up in a house like the Cicconettis’ or the Elias’ understood the deal — it was in the air, in the way your parents looked at you, in the silence after a bad report card, in the pride that radiated off them when you did something right:\nYou better be advancing this family.\nThat was the immigrant mentality, and it wasn’t optional. Your grandparents left everything — their village, their language, their parents’ graves — and crossed an ocean in steerage so that you could have more than they did. Your parents worked jobs that broke their bodies — refineries, factories, poultry markets, sewing machines — so that you wouldn’t have to. The debt was enormous, and it was repaid in one currency: progress.\nEvery generation was expected to climb higher than the last:\n\nThe first generation (the immigrants) did the crossing. They survived. They got jobs, learned enough English to function, and kept their families fed. That was the mission, and it was enough.\nThe second generation (Victor Sr., Frank Elia, Eleanor, Mary) was supposed to stabilize. Own a house. Stay out of trouble. Raise children who spoke English without an accent. Send them to school. Get them further from the boat.\nThe third generation (Vic, Yvonne) was supposed to arrive. Get educated. Get a career — not a job, a career. Become professionals. Become Americans who nobody could look down on. And then raise children who went even further.\n\nThis wasn’t pressure in the way modern parenting books describe pressure. It was deeper than that. It was identity. You didn’t advance just for yourself — you advanced for every person who came before you, for every sacrifice that made your life possible. When Vic got his education degree, that wasn’t just Vic succeeding. That was Collepietro succeeding. That was the steerage crossing paying off. That was the whole project of immigration being validated.\nAnd it worked. A poultry processor’s daughter married a refinery worker’s grandson, and together they produced educators, technologists, and professionals. The immigrant bet — leave everything, cross the ocean, work until your hands bleed, and trust that the children will rise — that bet paid off, spectacularly, in the Cicconetti family.\nBut the mentality never fully left. Even now, even at eighty, Vic’s pride in his children’s accomplishments — “Dearest Son, I hope you can take a long breath and exhale!!!!” — carries the echo of a grandfather he may never have met, standing on the deck of a steamship, watching the Statue of Liberty appear through the fog, thinking: this better be worth it.\nIt was.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteThe Italian-American Political Journey\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wide lens: The Italian-American political story is one of the great migrations in American electoral history — and it mirrors the family’s journey from survival to arrival.\nThe FDR era (1930s–1960s): The first and second generation were Democrats, almost universally. FDR’s New Deal fed them during the Depression. Social Security, labor protections, public works jobs — these programs were lifelines for immigrant families hanging on by their fingernails. The Democratic Party was the party of the working man, and Italian-Americans were working men. In Bayonne, voting Democratic was as natural as going to Mass.\nThe JFK moment (1960): When John F. Kennedy won the presidency, Italian-American Catholics wept. A Catholic in the White House. The door was opening. Vic was fourteen. When Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on November 22, 1963, Vic was seventeen — old enough to feel it as a personal loss, not just a news event.\nThe Reagan shift (1980s): By the time Vic was a school administrator, the Italian-American political migration was underway. The children and grandchildren of immigrants had arrived — they owned homes, had careers, paid taxes, sent their kids to college. The Democratic Party’s focus was shifting toward constituencies that didn’t look like them. Ronald Reagan spoke their language: patriotism, strength, family values, the conviction that America was great because Americans worked hard. The Reagan Democrat was born — and in neighborhoods like the ones the Cicconettis came from, the shift was seismic and permanent.\nThe close-up: Vic’s politics are his politics, and they’re consistent with the man: a veteran who loves his country, a law-and-order believer shaped by the neighborhoods he grew up in, a self-made professional who believes in hard work over handouts. He watches Fox News. He listens to Mark Levin. He forwards articles and commentaries to his sons and his circle. Yvonne is right there with him — same values, same convictions, same channel.\nThis isn’t a contradiction of the immigrant story. It is the immigrant story. The family that crossed the ocean with nothing, worked their way up, and now believes fiercely in the country that made that climb possible — that’s a through line as straight as any in this book.",

    "text": "The American Generation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteThe World in 1946: When Victor Was Born\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor was born in the spring of 1946 — the first year of the Baby Boom. World War II had ended eight months earlier. His father Victor Sr. was 21, part of the generation that had fought or supported the war effort from the home front. The GI Bill was reshaping America — veterans buying houses, going to college, starting families. Bayonne’s refineries and shipyards were converting from wartime production back to commercial work.\nIn that same year: the United Nations held its first session. Churchill delivered the “Iron Curtain” speech. ENIAC, the first general-purpose computer, was unveiled. The world Vic was born into was inventing itself in real time.\nBy the time Vic was a teenager in the late 1950s, Bayonne was changing. The children and grandchildren of immigrants were moving to the suburbs. The old neighborhoods were thinning. The refineries were modernizing, needing fewer workers. But the values — family, faith, loyalty, the conviction that America rewards hard work — those stayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor Sr. & Eleanor\nVictor Cicconetti Sr. was born in Bayonne in 1925 — a son of the immigrant generation. He married Eleanor Salone, one of three sisters (Marge, Eleanor, Josie) raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Their parents were Joseph (Giuseppe) Salone and Anna (Nunziana Castro) Salone.\nDuring the Depression, all three Salone sisters spent time in an orphanage until their mother Anna found work as a sweatshop seamstress and brought them home. Eleanor eventually followed her sister Marge to Bayonne — the classic pattern of one sibling establishing a foothold and others following.\nVictor Sr. and Eleanor started their family in New York City — on 10th Street and Avenue C — before moving to Bayonne when young Vic was about ten years old. The family moved several times within Bayonne: 19th St & Broadway, West 21st St, 525 Boulevard, 27th St & Broadway, and finally 700 Boulevard.\nThey raised six children:\n\nVictor R. (~1946, born in NYC)\nDennis (deceased)\nRev. Leanora (~1958)\nRobert “Bob”\nLoretta (d. ~2025)\nMichael C. (1961–2009)\n\nVictor Sr. struggled with alcoholism — a battle that shaped the household and left marks on every child who grew up in it. It was the shadow side of the immigrant story: the pressures of assimilation, of providing, of carrying a family forward in a country that demanded everything and forgave nothing. He died in 1980 at just ~55. Eleanor followed in 1997.\nWhat Victor Sr. gave his children was complicated — the good and the hard, tangled together. But what his eldest son Vic did with that inheritance was unambiguous: he saw what he didn’t want to repeat, and he chose differently. That choice would define his life.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrank & Mary Elia\nFrank Elia and Mary (nee Chiarolanza) raised their children in Bayonne:\n\nYvonne C. Elia (~1948)\nMary Ann Elia (later Hurley)\nAnd others in the extended family circle\n\nBut tragedy struck around 1962: Frank died, leaving Yvonne fatherless at about fourteen years old. It was a loss that shaped everything about who Yvonne would become — resilient, caring, fiercely devoted to family.\nAfter Frank’s death, Mary married Anthony Galella — a man who became a beloved stepfather. His impact was lasting enough that Greg would one day name his own son Anthony in his honor.\nMary Ann married Michael Hurley Sr., who rose to the rank of Captain in the Bayonne Police Department. Their daughter Kathy Pacifico has run Forum Fitness Club in Bayonne since 1982. Their son Mike Jr. was honored in 2023 for donating World Trade Center steel for the city’s 9/11 memorial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCheck Our Work — The American Generation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\nWe wrote…\nTRUE\nFALSE\nI DON’T KNOW\n\n\n\n\n5\nVictor Sr. was born in Bayonne in 1925\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nThe six children were: Victor, Dennis, Leanora, Bob, Loretta, Michael\n\n\n\n\n\n7\nThe Salone sisters spent time in an orphanage during the Depression\n\n\n\n\n\n8\nFrank died around 1962 when Yvonne was about 14\n\n\n\n\n\n9\nAfter Frank’s death, Mary married Anthony Galella\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything wrong?

What’s the story the family always tells about them?\nAnyone who remembers Frank Elia or Anthony Galella: Same question — who were these men beyond what the records can tell us?\n\n\n\nIn this same small city — a 1.2-square-mile peninsula where everyone lived within a fifteen-block radius — two Italian-American families were raising the next generation. Their churches were blocks apart. Their neighborhoods overlapped. Their values were the same: hard work, family loyalty, Catholic faith, and the conviction that America offered what the old country never could.\nA boy named Victor was growing up on one block. A girl named Yvonne was growing up on another.\nThey didn’t know it yet.

What would you want your grandkids to know about growing up Cicconetti in Bayonne?\nMom: Same question from the Elia side. What was your Bayonne like? What do you remember about your father Frank? About your mother’s sewing at Maidenform? About the neighborhood around Mt. Carmel Church?\nAunt Leanora: You’ve been researching the family tree.

It would later be called the “Long Hot Summer” — over 150 race riots erupted across U.S. cities.\nThe local lens: Five weeks before the wedding — July 12–17, 1967 — the Newark riots tore through a city less than 20 miles from Assumption Church. Twenty-six people died. Over 700 were injured. The National Guard rolled armored vehicles through streets that Bayonne families drove through every day. The smoke was visible from the waterfront.\nBayonne itself was tense. The city’s Italian-American neighborhoods bordered Black neighborhoods. The police force — where Yvonne’s brother-in-law Michael Hurley would later serve — was on high alert. This was the America that Vic and Yvonne were building their life inside.\nThe wide lens: That same summer — 100,000 American troops were in Vietnam. The Six-Day War had just reshaped the Middle East in June. Muhammad Ali had been stripped of his title for refusing the draft. The Beatles released Sgt. Pepper’s. Thurgood Marshall was confirmed as the first Black Supreme Court Justice.\nAnd on August 20, in the middle of all of it, a young airman on active duty and a girl from the neighborhood walked into Assumption Church and said yes.",

    "text": "NoteAmerica Through Vic’s Education Career (1970–2000)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wide lens: Vic entered education during a period of extraordinary upheaval in American schools and society. The thirty years he spent as an administrator spanned:\n\n1970s: Post-Vietnam malaise, Watergate, oil crisis, stagflation. Schools navigated desegregation, busing conflicts, and the first wave of federal education mandates. New Jersey’s Robinson v. Cahill ruling (1973) established that the state must equalize school funding — a battle that would define NJ education for decades.\n1980s: The Reagan revolution. In 1983, the federal report A Nation at Risk declared that “the educational foundations of our society are presently being eroded by a rising tide of mediocrity.” The Challenger explosion (January 28, 1986) — with teacher Christa McAuliffe aboard — was watched live in classrooms across America. Black Monday (October 19, 1987) crashed stock markets. That same year, the Red Bank Register was profiling Vic as “Man with Many Missions.”\n1990s: The LA riots erupted in April 1992 after the Rodney King verdict — six days of fires, 63 dead, $1 billion in damage. Schools across America grappled with race, justice, and how to talk to students about a world that seemed to be unraveling on live television. Then Columbine in April 1999 — 13 dead in a suburban high school — changed school security forever.\n\nThe New Jersey lens: In 1990, the NJ Supreme Court’s Abbott v. Burke decision identified 31 “Abbott districts” — the state’s poorest urban school systems — and mandated that the state fund them at the same level as the wealthiest suburbs. Both Asbury Park and Long Branch were Abbott districts. Vic wasn’t administering schools in quiet suburbs — he was in the districts where the fight over equity, funding, and opportunity was most intense.\nThe close-up: Through all of this, Vic showed up. Every day, every year, for three decades. A Vietnam veteran running schools in communities that needed steady leadership. A man who had seen combat choosing to spend his career in service to young people — many of them from the same working-class backgrounds he came from.",

    "section": "Long Branch High School",
    "text": "Long Branch High School\nVictor’s career at Long Branch High School wasn’t a single role — it was a climb. He started in the business department as a teacher, rose to department head, and eventually became assistant principal. Each step reflected the same pattern: Vic didn’t just show up and do the job — he built, he led, he pushed for more.\n\nThe Computer Pioneer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote1982: When Computers Were Still Science Fiction\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wide lens: In 1982, the personal computer was barely a consumer product. IBM had released the PC in August 1981. Apple’s Lisa was still a year away. The Macintosh wouldn’t arrive until 1984. Most American schools had zero computers. The ones that did had a single machine in a closet somewhere, gathering dust.\nThe school lens: Getting computers into a New Jersey public high school in the early 1980s required more than a purchase order. It required grant money — and the hustle to find it, write the proposals, and convince administrators and school boards that these strange beige boxes were the future.\nThe close-up: Vic became famous at Long Branch for exactly this: bringing in grant money to put computers in classrooms. While other schools were debating whether to invest, Vic was already writing grants, acquiring machines, and getting students’ hands on keyboards.\n\n\n\nVictor was ahead of his time on technology. He became known at Long Branch for his ability to bring in grant funding to get computers into the school — at a time when most educators were still skeptical. He founded the school’s Stock Market Club, teaching students about investing, finance, and the real-world applications of the business curriculum he’d built.\nThe Cicconetti home was a reflection of his conviction. From around 1982 onward, there was always a computer of some kind in the house:\n\nCommodore 64 and VIC-20 — the machines that brought computing to middle-class American homes\nThe full parade of floppy disk formats — from the massive 8-inch floppies to the 5¼-inch disks to the 3½-inch “hard” floppies\nEach generation replaced by the next, because Vic stayed current\n\nThe kids grew up with computers not because they were wealthy, but because their father was a public school teacher who understood where the world was going — and made sure his students AND his children were ready for it.\nIt paid off. Vic’s desire to stay on the cutting edge of computing planted a seed — and the unspoken rule did the rest. His son Greg would take that inheritance to the next level, building a career in biostatistics, computational drug development, and data science. A Ph.D. from UConn. A faculty appointment. Research Fellow at AbbVie. The through line from a business teacher writing grants for Commodore 64s to a son building statistical models for drug development is straighter than it looks.\nFour generations: a stone village in the Apennines → steerage class → a refinery town → a public school teacher hustling for computer grants → a Research Fellow. The immigrant bet, compounding.\n\n\n“Man with Many Missions”\nIn 1987, the Red Bank Register published a profile of Victor titled “Man with Many Missions” — a piece that captured the remarkable breadth of his life experience. The article included a photograph of Victor working at a computer at the school and described him as embodying “an American story,” noting his journey from military service through education.\nThat headline — “Man with Many Missions” — became something of an unofficial motto. It captured Victor’s essential nature: a man who never limited himself to a single role, a single community, or a single way of serving.\n\n\nApril 1992: The Walkout\nThen came the moment that tested everything.\nOn April 29, 1992, a jury in Simi Valley, California acquitted four LAPD officers of beating Rodney King — despite the entire country having watched the videotape. Los Angeles erupted. Six days of fires, 63 dead, over $1 billion in damage. The images — buildings burning, the National Guard on American streets, Rodney King asking “Can we all get along?” — were broadcast into every living room and every school in America.\nThe shock wave reached Long Branch.\nThe students of Long Branch High School walked out of class.\nImagine the scene. A diverse student body in a working-class Shore city, watching their country tear itself apart on television, feeling the injustice in their bones — and deciding they couldn’t sit in a classroom and pretend it wasn’t happening. They walked out. Hundreds of students, out the doors, into the open.\nNow imagine being the administration. The faculty. The people responsible for the safety of every one of those kids. What do you do? Call the police? Lock the doors? Stand in their way? Let them go and hope for the best?\nVictor Cicconetti did none of those things. He walked out with them.\nAnd then he did something that no handbook prescribed, no training manual suggested, and no other administrator in the public school system of Long Branch, New Jersey was likely to attempt: he led the students in prayer.\nRight there. Outside the school. A Vietnam veteran, a public school assistant principal, standing in front of a crowd of angry, scared, heartbroken teenagers — and bringing them together in the only way he knew how. Not with a megaphone. Not with threats. Not with rules. With prayer.\nA photographer from the Asbury Park Press was there. The photo made the paper: Vic, leading students in prayer during the Long Branch High School walkout after the Rodney King verdict.\nThat photograph has been blown up, framed, and hung on the wall of the Cicconetti garage — the garage that became the family’s gathering spot, where Dad and the kids hung out, where the walls told the story of a life. And on that wall, among everything else, is the moment that captured who Victor Cicconetti really was when it mattered most.\nWhat’s the message? Greg puts it simply: He stood up. He took action to modulate that crowd. And he calmed them. That’s what leaders do. And he used the tactic of prayer — in a public school, where others wouldn’t have dared — because in that moment, the right thing to do and the safe thing to do were not the same thing. Vic chose the right thing.\nThe medic who healed in Vietnam. The teacher who brought computers to classrooms. The father who bumped a rifle score by a point. The assistant principal who walked into a student walkout and turned a potential riot into a prayer circle.\nMan with Many Missions. The Red Bank Register had no idea how right they were.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipThe Doppelgänger\n\n\n\nThe family has long joked that Vic’s black doppelgänger is Jesse Jackson. The resemblance is uncanny — the bearing, the build, the look. So when you picture Vic leading a diverse group of students in prayer outside a New Jersey high school in April 1992… you’re not far off from a scene that Jesse Jackson himself might have led. Sometimes life casts you perfectly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCheck Our Work — Education Career\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\nWe wrote…\nTRUE\nFALSE\nI DON’T KNOW\n\n\n\n\n1\nVic started as a teacher in the business department at Long Branch\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nHe rose to department head, then assistant principal\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nHe founded the Stock Market Club\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nHe brought in grant money to get computers into classrooms\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nThe Red Bank Register profiled him in 1987\n\n\n\n\n\n5a\nStudents walked out after the Rodney King verdict (April 1992)\n\n\n\n\n\n5b\nVic led the students in prayer during the walkout\n\n\n\n\n\n5c\nThe Asbury Park Press published a photo of it\n\n\n\n\n\n5d\nThat photo is framed and hanging in the garage\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nThe family had computers from ~1982 onward (Commodore, VIC-20, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n7\nHe retired from education in 2000\n\n\n\n\n\n8\nYvonne taught health in Jersey City public schools\n\n\n\n\n\n9\nYvonne retired in 2005\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything wrong?

The reality was more complicated. By the time Vic arrived as a school administrator, Asbury Park had been through the 1970 Asbury Park riots — four days of unrest that devastated the city’s commercial district along Springwood Avenue. The boardwalk that Springsteen romanticized was surrounded by blocks of urban decay. The Stone Pony was playing to half-empty rooms. The population dropped from 17,000 in 1970 to under 16,000 by 1990.\nThe school lens: As an Abbott district, Asbury Park’s schools were chronically underfunded relative to need. The student body was diverse, the challenges were real, and the stakes were high. Being an administrator here meant more than managing a building — it meant being a stabilizing presence in a community that was fighting to hold itself together.\nThe close-up: Vic chose to work here. A man from Bayonne’s Italian-American neighborhoods, a Vietnam veteran, working in Asbury Park’s public schools — it was service in the truest sense. The same commitment to healing that put him on medevac helicopters in Southeast Asia drove him to serve students in one of New Jersey’s most challenged communities.\n\n\n\nVictor also worked as a public school administrator in the Asbury Park school district, continuing his commitment to students across Monmouth County. Asbury Park — famous for its boardwalk, its music scene, and its complicated history of urban renewal — presented its own challenges and rewards for an educator committed to making a difference.",

    "text": "Shark River Hills and the Jersey Shore\nWhile Vic was building schools, the family was building a life. Victor and Yvonne settled in Shark River Hills — an unincorporated community within Neptune Township — and later in Wall Township, both in the heart of Monmouth County’s Jersey Shore corridor.\nThis wasn’t just geography. This was identity. The Shore defined the Cicconetti family’s daily life for decades:\n\nShark River Hills — tucked along the Shark River inlet, a neighborhood of modest homes where you could smell the salt air and hear the gulls. The kind of place where kids rode bikes to the river and families knew their neighbors by name.\nWall Township — a larger suburban community just inland from the beach towns, where the family put down deeper roots. Good schools (Vic knew this better than anyone), safe streets, and easy access to the Shore.\n\nThe surrounding towns became the family’s stomping grounds: Avon-by-the-Sea, Point Pleasant Beach, and the boardwalk joints and seafood houses that define Shore life. These weren’t vacation destinations — they were the backdrop to daily life. Little League games, Sunday drives, summer evenings on the boardwalk.\nAnd the restaurants — the places that became family institutions:\n\nPete & Elda’s in Neptune City — the bar/restaurant where the thin-crust pizza has been a Shore institution since 1956. Every Shore family has their Pete & Elda’s stories.\nKelly’s Tavern — cold drinks, good food, the kind of place where you run into everyone you know.\n\nThese were the family’s places. The spots where the Cicconettis gathered, celebrated, and lived the life that Vic had built from nothing — from a Bayonne row house to a Shore family raising kids in the salt air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteYour Turn — The Shore Years\n\n\n\n\n\nDad & Mom: What was the house in Shark River Hills like?

    "section": "A New Church",
    "text": "A New Church\nBut first, the church they left.\nThe Cicconettis were Catholic — cradle to confirmation, baptism to burial, the whole program. Assumption Church in Bayonne, CCD classes, Sunday Mass in your good clothes whether you wanted to or not. And for a while, the rhythm held. The kids went to grammar school through the parish system the way Italian-American kids did.\nBut somewhere around the time Rich finished grammar school, the family collectively — quietly, without any dramatic declaration — stopped going. No one nailed theses to the church door. There was no schism. They were just… done. The monotony of it. The same readings, the same responses, the same kneeling and standing. Week after week after week. For a family as restless and forward-moving as the Cicconettis, the passive rhythm of the Catholic Mass had become wallpaper. They could recite it in their sleep, and that was exactly the problem.\nThey weren’t alone. Across America, the 1970s and ‘80s saw a quiet exodus from mainline churches — Catholic and Protestant alike. The cultural upheavals of the 1960s had loosened institutional religion’s grip. Vatican II had modernized the Mass but confused the faithful. The Jesus Movement, charismatic Christianity, and evangelical megachurches were pulling Americans toward more personal, emotional worship experiences. The Catholic Church, with its hierarchy and ritual, felt to many families like their parents’ religion — inherited, unexamined, going through the motions.\nThe Cicconettis were part of that wave. Not hostile to faith. Not atheists. Just done with the format.\nAnd then Vic did something that nobody from Assumption Church in Bayonne would have predicted: he joined a Baptist church in Shark River Hills.\nFor a man raised in that Italian-American Catholic tradition — baptized, confirmed, married at the altar, Sunday Mass without question — walking into a Baptist congregation was a move. It wasn’t rebellion. It wasn’t rejection. It was Vic doing what Vic always does: challenging himself.\nBut there was more to it than spiritual curiosity. Vic had seen what unchecked habits could do to a man. His father, Victor Sr., had struggled with alcoholism — seriously, not casually. Vic grew up watching that. And when Vic looked at his own life — a Vietnam veteran, a school administrator, a father of three — he made a decision that took a different kind of courage than anything he’d done in Southeast Asia: he decided to change.\nThe Baptist church became a vehicle for that change. The structure, the community, the accountability, the discipline of studying scripture rather than just attending Mass out of habit — Vic used all of it. He wasn’t running from Catholicism. He was running toward the man he wanted to be. The same man who chose to be a medic instead of a rifleman, who wrote grants for computers when other teachers were skeptical, who founded a veterans’ chapter from scratch — that man decided to confront his own vulnerabilities head-on, in a room full of people who didn’t share his last name or his neighborhood.\nHe didn’t just attend. He read the Bible cover to cover — at least once, possibly twice. He led youth groups at the church. He committed. Fully.\nAnd the kids? Greg hated it at the time. The teenage resistance to anything your father is enthusiastic about — multiplied by the awkwardness of switching religious traditions mid-childhood. But looking back, Greg sees it for what it was: his father refusing to coast. Refusing to inherit a faith — or a fate — without examining it. Deciding, in his forties, to choose rather than default. To break a cycle rather than repeat it.\nRich, on the other hand, was a rock star. The church ran a program called Christian Crusaders — a Baptist variant of Boy Scouts, with camping trips, outings, and the whole structure of youth leadership that scouting provides. Rich thrived in it. Completely at home. The same kid who would later build a tech business and stay close to his parents in Galloway — that kid was already showing his character in Christian Crusaders, earning badges and leading campouts.\nThe faith journey — from Assumption Church to a Baptist congregation to the man who writes “the Lord has blessed you” in every milestone email — is its own kind of through line. Vic’s faith isn’t inherited. It’s earned. He did the reading. He did the work. He chose it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCheck Our Work — Faith\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\nWe wrote…\nTRUE\nFALSE\nI DON’T KNOW\n\n\n\n\n1\nVic joined a Baptist church in Shark River Hills\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nHe read the Bible cover to cover (at least once)\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nHe led youth groups at the church\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nRich was active in Christian Crusaders\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything wrong?

He and Yvonne took their Italian heritage from the family kitchen to the business world, co-founding Bistro-by-the-Sea in Avon-by-the-Sea, NJ with their son Richard. A family venture that combined food, hospitality, and the entrepreneurial spirit — three Cicconettis working side by side, turning heritage into a business.\nThe restaurant sat at 140 South Riverside Drive along the Shark River — technically a Neptune mailing address, right on the border with Avon-by-the-Sea. A waterfront-adjacent spot in Monmouth County, just south of Asbury Park and Bradley Beach. Classic Jersey Shore territory where restaurants are as much a part of summer as the boardwalk.\nBistro-by-the-Sea was a casual, family-friendly Italian spot — pizza, Italian fare, affordable prices, and open from 6 AM through 9 PM. Breakfast through dinner, seven days a week. That’s not a hobby. That’s a family pouring everything they have into a business.\nRunning a restaurant is one of the most demanding small-business ventures there is. Long hours, tight margins, constant attention to quality and customer experience. Doing it as a family adds another layer — the intimacy of working alongside your spouse and your son, day after day, meal after meal.",

For a generation that came home to silence, every parade was a reclamation. Every step said: we served, we’re here, and we’re not ashamed.\nBut there’s one parade image that captures something deeper than veteran pride. Picture this:\nVictor Cicconetti, Vietnam veteran, marching with his fellow vets — and in the same parade, in a different formation, his sons marching in NJROTC uniforms with the Marine Academy of Science and Technology (MAST).\nMAST — the elite magnet school at Sandy Hook, part of the Monmouth County Vocational School District — combined rigorous STEM academics with Naval ROTC discipline. The Cicconetti boys were there, in uniform, marching in the same parade as their father.\nThink about what Vic saw when he looked across that parade route: his own journey reflected back at him. A Vietnam veteran medic who came home and built a life — and now his sons, in uniform, getting the education and discipline that would launch them into their own careers. The immigrant bet, compounding again. Three generations from Collepietro to NJROTC dress whites.\nThat was a point of pride that went beyond the parade. That was the whole project — the whole family mission — made visible in a single afternoon on a Jersey Shore boulevard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCheck Our Work — Parades & MAST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\nWe wrote…\nTRUE\nFALSE\nI DON’T KNOW\n\n\n\n\n1\nVic marched in Vietnam veteran parades\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nRich and Greg attended MAST (Marine Academy of Science and Technology)\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nThe sons marched in NJROTC in the same parades as Vic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything wrong?

He was in it — organizing practices, running drills, doing the thing that dads in Shore communities did on Saturday mornings. He loved it.\nGreg did not love it. Greg did not love any of it.\nThe Greg Cicconetti athletic career is a highlight reel of heroic disinterest:\n\nBaseball: Famous for doing cartwheels in the outfield and kicking dandelions while the game happened around him. The uniforms were itchy. The whole enterprise was suspect.\nSoccer: The only goal Greg ever scored was in kindergarten — and it was against his own team. Career shooting percentage: technically perfect, if you don’t ask which net.\nBasketball: Lasted exactly one session. There was no second session.\n\nVic, the former “Glue Fingers” of Bayonne high school football, watched all of this and did not give up. That’s its own kind of parenting — the athlete father who keeps showing up for the kid who is never going to be an athlete, without making the kid feel like a failure for it.\n\nThe Marksman Medal\nBut the rifle team — that’s where the story gets complicated, and real, and Vic.\nGreg was on the rifle team. Vic was there as parent support — involved, present, doing the behind-the-scenes work that makes youth programs run. At a competition, Greg’s score came in just shy of making marksman. One point short.\nAnd Vic — the rule-follower, the school administrator, the man who built his career on institutional trust — bumped the score by a point. He pushed his son across the line.\nGreg hated it. He didn’t want to cheat. He knew the score was wrong. But in that moment, standing there with a medal he hadn’t quite earned, Greg also understood something fundamental about his father: Vic breaks rules to advance people. Not for himself — for other people. His son. His students. The kid across the street. If someone was one point short, one step behind, one push away from making it — Vic would provide the push. Every time. Without hesitation.\nGreg wore the medal without a second thought. Not because the score was right, but because the man behind it was.\n\n\nThe Pusher\nThat instinct — I will get you across the finish line — is the thread that runs through everything Vic did as a father:\n\nHe pushed Rich across the finish line with his schooling — the kind of sustained, daily, unglamorous parental pressure that doesn’t make the highlight reel but makes the diploma possible.\nHe helped Yvonne when she went back to advance her teaching credentials — supporting her education the same way he supported his students’, because the unspoken rule applied to everyone under his roof. Everyone advances. No exceptions.\nHe pushed his students at Long Branch — the grants for computers, the Stock Market Club, the extra effort that turned a business department into a launchpad.\n\nThis is the core of Vic’s character, and it’s more nuanced than “proud dad.” He’s not just proud of his children’s accomplishments. He’s in the engine room of those accomplishments, pushing, adjusting, occasionally bending a rule when the rule is the only thing standing between someone he loves and the thing they deserve.\nIs it always by the book? No. But the man who flew medevac in Vietnam didn’t learn his ethics from a book. He learned them from the conviction that you do whatever it takes to get your people home safe — and “home safe” includes a marksman medal, a diploma, a teaching credential, and a career.",

The Cicconettis lived through all of them:\nThe 1960s — Bell-bottoms, tie-dye, the British Invasion, muscle cars, and the space race. The Flintstones was primetime television. The family watched the moon landing on a black-and-white TV — every American did. JFK’s assassination. The Beatles on Ed Sullivan. Woodstock (though Bayonne Italians were not exactly the Woodstock demographic).\nThe 1970s — Disco, leisure suits, the pet rock, mood rings, and the energy crisis. Gas lines. Watergate on television every night. Star Wars changed everything in 1977. The Bee Gees were inescapable. Every neighborhood had a kid with a skateboard and a kid with a CB radio. Earth shoes. Macramé plant hangers. The Brady Bunch as aspirational family life.\nThe 1980s — Aerobics, leg warmers, Members Only jackets, Pac-Man, the Walkman, and MTV. Reagan was president and the Berlin Wall came down. E.T. made every kid want a bike with a basket. Cabbage Patch Kids caused actual fistfights in stores. The Rubik’s Cube. Atari, then Nintendo. Hair got bigger. Shoulder pads got bigger. The fitness craze hit hard — Jane Fonda tapes, Jazzercise, running became a lifestyle, not just exercise. The Cicconettis and Hurleys caught this wave fully.\nThe 1990s — Grunge killed hair metal. Beanie Babies became investment vehicles (they weren’t). The Macarena. Fanny packs. Rollerblades. Seinfeld and Friends defined the decade. The internet arrived — slowly, then all at once. AOL dial-up. “You’ve got mail.” The Y2K panic. Everyone bought a cell phone the size of a brick and felt like James Bond.\nThe 2000s — Reality TV took over (Survivor, American Idol, Jersey Shore — yes, Jersey Shore). Facebook launched. The iPhone arrived in 2007 and nothing was ever the same. Crocs. Low-rise jeans. The housing boom, then the crash. Everyone got a GPS and stopped asking for directions. DVDs replaced VHS, then streaming replaced DVDs.\nWhat stuck: Through every fad that came and went — pet rocks, Beanie Babies, fidget spinners — the things that lasted in the Cicconetti household were the things that mattered: family dinners, Shore trips, faith, and the belief that you show up for the people you love. The leisure suits went to Goodwill. The family stayed.",

It’s part of the NJ retirement lifestyle, and Vic and Yvonne are regulars. And AC has delivered its share of stories — including the time Vic shook hands with O.J. Simpson at a fight in Atlantic City. Yes, that O.J. The kind of random, only-in-AC celebrity encounter that becomes a family story told at every gathering for the next thirty years. Vic was there. O.J. was there. Hands were shaken. The family has opinions.\nTarget practice at 75 — In September 2021, Vic forwarded a Heartland America ad for a Beeman Sportsman Deluxe Air Pistol ($49.99, .177 caliber) and asked Greg to order it. At seventy-five, Vic was still shooting, still active, still keeping his edge. The casual “Love DAD” sign-off on a request for ammunition is peak Vic.\nThe daily briefing — Vic stays engaged with the world. Fox News is the soundtrack of the house. Mark Levin is the voice on the radio. He and Yvonne watch, listen, debate, and form opinions — together, always together. They are not passive consumers. They are citizens who care deeply about the direction of their country, informed by a lifetime of experience that runs from Vietnam to the present.\nWisdom curator — Vic forwards emails to his sons and brother-in-law Mike Hurley about life philosophy, faith, humor, and politics. He doesn’t just consume this content — he curates it, selecting messages he believes carry real meaning and sharing them with the people he loves. The “Gift of Time” parable about Alexander the Great. Patriotic stories. Inspirational messages. Political commentary. Life lessons. Vic sees himself as passing wisdom — and conviction — to the next generation. The forward list is his broadcast network, and the signal is always the same: this matters, and I want you to see it.",

The wringer washer became an automatic. The dish-drying rack became a dishwasher. The percolator became a Mr. Coffee became a Keurig. Frozen TV dinners arrived in 1954 and blew people’s minds. The microwave oven — military technology repurposed for leftovers — showed up in homes in the late 1970s and changed what “cooking” even meant.\nIn the living room: Three channels became cable (1980s) became satellite (1990s) became streaming (2010s) became too many choices to count. The family gathered around one television; now everyone has a screen in their pocket. The VCR arrived and you could record a show — revolutionary. Then the DVD. Then the DVR. Then Netflix made all of it obsolete. Vic has lived through every format of recorded entertainment: vinyl records, 8-tracks, cassette tapes, CDs, MP3s, and whatever his grandkids are using now.\nIn communication: The rotary phone (shared, on the wall, don’t tie up the line) became the push-button phone became the cordless phone became the cell phone became the smartphone. The answering machine was a miracle — someone could leave a message when you weren’t home! Then voicemail. Then text messages. Then FaceTime. Vic’s generation went from waiting for the mail to instant video calls with grandchildren 200 miles away. His email forwards — the ones he curates and sends to his sons every morning — are his version of the letters his grandparents sent from Italy. Same instinct. Different wire.\nIn the car: No seatbelts → seatbelts → airbags → backup cameras → cars that park themselves. Manual everything → power steering → cruise control → GPS navigation. Vic learned to drive on a car you had to crank. His grandchildren will learn to drive on cars that drive themselves.\nIn school (where Vic spent his career): Chalkboards → overhead projectors → VCRs in the classroom → computer labs → laptops for every student → AI tutors. Vic was ahead of this curve — writing grants for Commodore computers in 1982 when most schools didn’t even have a computer room. He saw the future before the district budget caught up.\nThe man who was born into a world of rotary phones and iceboxes now lives in a world of smartphones and AI. And he adapted to every single transition — not because he’s a technologist, but because he’s a man who refuses to be left behind.",

Somewhere in a box or a scrapbook, there’s an old newspaper clipping where a young Victor Cicconetti earned the nickname “Glue Fingers Cicconetti” — a receiver who didn’t drop the ball. That was high school football in Bayonne, where Friday nights under the lights were the center of the social universe and a good nickname followed you for life.\nIn his later years, Vic has enjoyed periodic gatherings with his old high school football buddies — the guys who blocked for him, ran alongside him, and shared the locker room camaraderie that becomes, decades later, one of the purest forms of friendship a man can have. No pretense. No agenda. Just men who knew each other when they were seventeen and still show up for each other at seventy-nine.\nThe football brotherhood and the veteran brotherhood overlap in Vic’s life — both are groups of men who went through something intense together and never let go of the bond. “Glue Fingers” caught passes in Bayonne. Then he caught wounded soldiers in medevac helicopters. Then he caught students who were falling through the cracks. The hands never stopped reaching.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCheck Our Work — Football\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\nWe wrote…\nTRUE\nFALSE\nI DON’T KNOW\n\n\n\n\n1\nVic played high school football in Bayonne\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nHe was nicknamed “Glue Fingers Cicconetti”\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nHe still gathers with old football friends\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat school?

At 79, they still make the pilgrimage — north on the Parkway to the places where they raised their family, where the kids grew up, where the memories live.\nThe destinations are always the same, because that’s the point:\n\nAvon-by-the-Sea — the quiet beach town with the Victorian boardwalk, where the ocean is the attraction and the crowds stay away. Not Seaside Heights. Not Wildwood. Avon. That tells you everything about Vic and Yvonne’s taste.\nPoint Pleasant Beach — the boardwalk, Jenkinson’s, the fishing pier, the arcades where the grandkids play the same games the kids played thirty years ago. Shore culture passed down.\nPete & Elda’s — the thin-crust pizza institution in Neptune City, open since 1956. Every Shore family has a Pete & Elda’s booth that feels like theirs. The Cicconettis’ is no different.\nKelly’s Tavern — cold drinks, familiar faces, the kind of place where Vic walks in and someone says “hey, Vic.”\n\nThese aren’t restaurants and beaches. They’re landmarks on the map of a life. The Shark River Hills years (1980–1995), the Wall years (1995–2000), the Neptune years (2000–2020) — decades of Shore living compressed into an afternoon drive and a pizza that tastes like 1985.\nThat they still make this trip, into their late seventies and now approaching eighty — that’s not nostalgia. That’s identity. The Jersey Shore isn’t where Vic vacations. It’s where Vic is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteMap: The Shore — Then and Now\n\n\n\n\n\nFour decades of Shore living: Shark River Hills (1980–1995) → Wall (1995–2000) → Neptune (2000–2020) → Blue Heron Pines (2020–present).

The beach day that went sideways? The Pete & Elda’s night that turned legendary? The time at Kelly’s that nobody’s allowed to talk about? The boardwalk game somebody FINALLY won after twenty years of trying?\nDad & Mom: Is there a beach, a bench, a spot on the boardwalk that’s yours? The place you go when it’s just the two of you?",

The Vic kind — persistent, vocal, and coming at you whether you asked for it or not.\n\n“The Lord has blessed you once more.”\n\nThat’s how he frames milestones — as blessings, not just achievements. Every email, every phone call, every milestone: pray about it. A grandchild’s graduation? The Lord has blessed you. A new job? God is good. A rough patch? Have you prayed on it?\nHere’s the thing: the Cicconetti family stopped going to church decades ago. After Rich finished grammar school, they were done with the monotony of Catholic Mass. The whole family moved on. And then Vic found his Baptist church, did his deep dive into scripture, and came out the other side as the family’s permanent, unsolicited spiritual advisor.\nThe joke in the family — and it is a joke, told with love — goes like this:\n“Did Dad have a few drinks and corner you to talk about the Bible again?”\nBecause that’s what happens. A family gathering. A barbecue. A holiday. Vic has a couple of drinks, and suddenly you’re getting a one-on-one about prayer, about gratitude, about what the scriptures say about perseverance. He doesn’t do it from a pulpit. He does it from a lawn chair, or the kitchen counter, or the driver’s seat on the way to Point Pleasant. He persists through resistance. He always persists through resistance.\nNobody in the family goes to church anymore. But Vic never stopped being the voice that says: pray. Pray when things are good. Pray when things are bad. Pray when you don’t feel like it. Especially when you don’t feel like it.\nIt’s not performative. It’s not preachy — well, it’s a little preachy. But it’s real. The man who read the Bible cover to cover, who led youth groups, who joined a Baptist church to challenge himself — that man didn’t stop when the formal churchgoing stopped. He just moved the ministry to the dinner table, the phone call, the email forward. His congregation is his family, and his sermons never end.\nThe Catholic boy from Bayonne, who married at Assumption Church, who left the monotony of Mass, who walked into a Baptist church, who read the whole book, who now signs his emails with “God bless” and calls his sons to tell them to pray — that man’s faith isn’t a Sunday habit. It’s a Tuesday habit. A Wednesday habit. An every-damn-day habit. And if you’re within earshot after he’s had a glass of wine? You’re going to hear about it.",

    "text": "The Walk-Around-the-House Laugh\nAfter his 75th birthday party in 2021, Vic sent a thank-you email to Greg’s family that captures something essential about who he is:\n\n“I am still laughing at your antics on the video. I can be walking around the house and suddenly I think of Greg and Val and man I start smiling then laughing.”\n\nPicture it: Vic, alone in the house, walking from room to room, and suddenly — a memory from the party hits him, and he laughs out loud. Not once, but again and again, days later. This is a man who holds joy close. Who lets the good moments replay. Who walks around his house and laughs at the love of his family.\nThat image — Vic wandering the house, suddenly breaking into laughter — belongs in any portrait of who this man really is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAmerica’s Changing Relationship with Marijuana\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wide lens: Few substances trace the arc of American culture as cleanly as marijuana. When Vic was growing up in the 1950s, cannabis was the stuff of Reefer Madness propaganda — a Schedule I narcotic lumped with heroin, a moral panic in plant form. By the time he was in Vietnam, it was everywhere among the troops — a coping mechanism for the uncopeable.\n\n1970: Nixon signed the Controlled Substances Act, classifying marijuana as Schedule I — “no accepted medical use, high potential for abuse.” The War on Drugs began.\n1980s–90s: Reagan and Clinton escalated enforcement. “Just Say No.” Mandatory minimums. By 1997, nearly 700,000 Americans were arrested annually for marijuana offenses — more than for all violent crimes combined.\n1996: California passed Proposition 215, the first medical marijuana law. The dam cracked.\n2012: Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize recreational use.\n2020: New Jersey voters approved Question 1, legalizing recreational marijuana. Vic’s home state.\n2024: By now, 24 states plus DC have legalized recreational use. The substance that could get you prison time when Vic was raising his family is now sold in storefronts down the road from his house.\n\nThe generation that grew up with “Just Say No” is now the generation buying edibles at a dispensary. The country didn’t just change its laws — it changed its entire moral framework around a plant. For a man who has lived through Vietnam, Watergate, the War on Drugs, and legalization — all in one lifetime — the whiplash is its own kind of American experience.",

    "section": "How This Book Was Made",
    "text": "How This Book Was Made\nDad, you might be wondering: how did they put all this together?\nHere’s the short version: Greg sat at his computer and told stories about you. That’s really it. He talked about growing up in Shark River Hills, about your career at Long Branch, about the restaurant, the parades, the Baptist church, the Shore trips, the emails you send at 6 AM. Everything he remembered. Everything the family remembers.\nBut he didn’t type the book himself. He had help from a new kind of tool — an artificial intelligence assistant called Claude. Think of it like this: if Greg hired a really good writer to help him organize his thoughts, that’s basically what happened. Except the writer lives inside the computer.\nHere’s how the process worked:\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[\"Greg tells family stories\\n(your son, at his computer)\"] --&gt; B[\"Claude listens and organizes\\n(the AI writing assistant)\"]\n    B --&gt; C[\"Draft chapters written\\n(10 chapters + appendices)\"]\n    C --&gt; D[\"Greg reviews every word\\n(nothing goes in without his OK)\"]\n    D --&gt; E{\"Accurate?\"}\n    E --&gt;|\"Yes\"| F[\"Keep it\"]\n    E --&gt;|\"Not quite\"| G[\"Greg corrects it\"]\n    G --&gt; B\n    F --&gt; H[\"Family reviews & adds stories\\n(that's where YOU come in)\"]\n    H --&gt; I[\"Published as a website\\n(the book you're reading now)\"]\n\n    style A fill:#4a90d9,color:#fff\n    style B fill:#7b68ee,color:#fff\n    style D fill:#4a90d9,color:#fff\n    style H fill:#e8963e,color:#fff\n    style I fill:#2ecc71,color:#fff\n\n\n How This Book Came Together \n\n\n\nIn plain English:\n\nGreg talked. He sat down over several sessions and told the story of your life — the parts he knows, the parts the family knows, the parts that come from your emails and photos and the stories you’ve told a hundred times at the dinner table.\nThe computer organized it. Claude took those stories and arranged them into chapters, added historical context (what was happening in the country during each era of your life), found the right music for each era, and made it look nice on the screen.\nGreg checked everything. Every single fact, every story, every detail — Greg read it and either approved it, corrected it, or said “that’s not right, here’s what really happened.” The AI doesn’t know your life — Greg does. Claude is the pen. Greg is the author.\nThe family fills in the gaps. That’s what those “Check Our Work” boxes are for — so you, Mom, Rich, Ellie, Anthony, and Richie can tell us what we got right, what we got wrong, and what stories we’re missing.\nIt became this website. The book you’re reading is a website that works on your computer, your phone, or a tablet. It’s not printed (yet — we might make a printed version too). The music links play real songs. The photos are from the family collection.\n\nWhat Greg actually did: He’s the architect of this whole thing. He decided what the book should be. He chose the structure. He told the stories. He picked the music. He reviewed every word. He’s the one who knows that “Glue Fingers” was your football nickname and that you shook O.J.’s hand in AC and that you read the Bible cover to cover. The AI doesn’t know any of that — it only knows what Greg tells it.\nWhat the AI did: It’s a tool, like a very sophisticated typewriter. It helped organize, it helped write, it helped research the historical context (what year the Berlin Wall fell, when the first microwave came out, how many Italians came through Ellis Island). It’s fast, it’s thorough, and it doesn’t get tired. But it can’t tell a single Cicconetti story without Greg putting it in.\nThink of it this way: You wrote grants to get computers into the classroom in 1982 because you believed technology could help students learn better. Forty-four years later, your son is using the grandchild of those computers to write a book about your life. The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, Dad. You started this.",
