# Session Closeout — dads80th

**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Duration context:** Focused session — sensitivity edits per Anthony's feedback

## Accomplished

### Ch8 Sensitivity Rewrite (commit fb28e68)
- Removed emphysema diagnosis and closet smoking details from Ch8 — read morbidly in a tribute context per Anthony
- Moved health details to author's notes only (`docs/victor.md`)
- Reframed "The Whole Man" section as "He Won't Back Down" — keeps the defiant spirit without naming the diagnosis
- Ch8 closer: "He did it his way. And the best is yet to come."
- Ch10 closer: "The best is yet to come." — Sinatra's closer
- Song sentiment anchored to Won't Back Down / End of the Line / My Way

## Outstanding
- **Gmail MCP auth expired** — `invalid_grant` error, can't read form response emails
- **Google Drive MCP not configured** — missing OAuth credentials file
- **Form triage pipeline** — no automated way to pull form responses yet
- **Book link not sent to family** — deployed at https://gcicc.github.io/dads80th/ but family hasn't been notified
- **Google Forms claim text outdated** — forms still have old text (e.g., "3 children"); only the book was corrected
- **Ch5 restaurant chapter** — still thin, needs family stories about Bistro-by-the-Sea
- **Ch9 voices** — still awaiting tribute messages from family
- **Unstaged changes:** `index.qmd` has a typo/corruption (`claud` prepended to first line), `GREG-do-this.md`, `backlog.md`, `SESSION_CLOSEOUT.md` modified
- **Untracked files:** `.mcp.json`, `.playwright-mcp/`, LaTeX file, `ch02-service.html`, `ch10-happy-80th_files/`, `images/P1020477.JPG`

## Next Action
**PROJECT PAUSED** — Greg is setting up PA spare laptop as R Shiny server to test data capture features. When resuming: fix `index.qmd` corruption (stray "claud" at line 1), commit outstanding changes, send book link to family.

## Blockers
- **TIME-SENSITIVE** — March 29, 2026 birthday (~6 weeks)
- **MCP auth broken** — Gmail and Google Drive tokens expired/missing. Blocks form triage.
- **Family engagement** — book is live but no one knows about it yet
- **Paused** — pivoting to PA laptop Shiny server setup for data capture testing
