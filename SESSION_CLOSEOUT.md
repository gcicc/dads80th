# Session Closeout — dads80th

**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Duration context:** Extended session (~2+ hours), continued from prior context window

## Accomplished
- Built complete dossier system from scratch: **129 dossier files** (114 people, 11 institutions, 4 entities)
- Cleared **all SEED entries** from `dossier-research-list.md` — every person/institution/entity now has an IN PROGRESS dossier file
- Pre-populated **45 interview questions** across 10 of 12 interviews with factual data from dossiers, gmail-intel, and institution profiles
- Created rich entity dossiers: Ronacaleret Program (4 publications, NCT numbers, efficacy data), SOLID-TIMI 52, Simulation Practices paper, ASA-DIA
- Integrated web research results: Takeda SQS org chart (30+ names), GSK/AbbVie colleague enrichment, TIMI co-author profiles
- Applied all corrections from Greg: Dennis deceased, Loretta deceased, Chris Hollander spelling, Riley Wexler (married to Ellie), Lorie Fitzpatrick, Uzma Atif (GOGO-Long), Oriane's three children
- Updated dossier-research-list.md from ~40 entries to 100+ entries with structured tables by era
- Created llc-consulting backlog with LLC vs non-profit assessment task
- Synced backlogs across dads80th and Lit-Project

## Outstanding
- None on the dossier front — system is built and fully populated
- `[Greg to fill]` placeholders exist for ~30 colleague personality/worker-type assessments (requires Greg's input during interviews)
- Uncommitted changes in both dads80th and Lit-Project repos

## Next Action
Begin Phase 1 deliverables for Victor's 80th birthday: define tribute document format, family tree scope, and event materials.

## Blockers
- **TIME-SENSITIVE:** Victor's 80th birthday ~March 2026 (~4-6 weeks out)
- Tribute document content depends on family input and photo assets (P1020477.JPG, Vimeo video)
